Zen emphasizes rigorous self-control, meditation-practice, insight into Buddha-nature, and the personal expression of this insight in daily life, especially for the benefit of others. As such, it de-emphasizes mere knowledge of sutras and doctrine and favors direct understanding through zazen and interaction with an accomplished teacher. \n\nThe teachings of Zen include various sources of Mahayana thought, especially Yogachara, the Tath\u0101gatagarbha s\u016btras and the Huayan school, with their emphasis on Buddha-nature, totality, and the Bodhisattva-ideal. The Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 literature and, to a lesser extent, Madhyamaka have also been influential in the shaping of the \"paradoxical language\" of the Zen-tradition. \n\nThe word \"Zen\" is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word \u79aa () (pinyin: \"Ch\u00e1n\"), which in turn is derived from the Sanskrit word \"dhy\u0101na\" (\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928 ), which can be approximately translated as \"absorption\" or \"meditative", "3xiqgxaumc8jkn8xmv4zdj2g3fu7x9_17": "e Indian practice of Dhyana (\"meditation\"", "3xiqgxaumc8jkn8xmv4zdj2g3fu7x9_18": "From China, Chan Buddhism spread south to Vietnam,", "3xiqgxaumc8jkn8xmv4zdj2g3fu7x9_19": "northeast to Korea and east to Japan", "3xiqgxaumc8jkn8xmv4zdj2g3fu7x9_20": "Japanese Zen", "3p529iw9kyl1zm6eqvznqhkauvzflx_1": "n Charles VIII out of Italy, ", "3p529iw9kyl1zm6eqvznqhkauvzflx_2": ". \n\nThe French lost Nap", "3p529iw9kyl1zm6eqvznqhkauvzflx_3": " July 7 Ferdinand II was able to reenter his capital and reascend his t", "3p529iw9kyl1zm6eqvznqhkauvzflx_4": "", "3p529iw9kyl1zm6eqvznqhkauvzflx_5": " July 7 Ferdinand II was able to reenter his capital and reascend his t", "3p529iw9kyl1zm6eqvznqhkauvzflx_6": "ne.

Historically in Yorkshire's West Riding, the history of Leeds can be traced to the 5th century, when the name referred to a wooded area of the Kingdom of Elmet. The name has been applied to many administrative entities over the centuries. It changed from being the name of a small manorial borough in the 13th century, through several incarnations, to being the name attached to the present metropolitan borough. In the 17th and 18th centuries Leeds became a major centre for the production and trading of wool. \n\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, Leeds developed into a major mill town; wool was the dominant industry but flax, engineering, iron foundries, printing, and other industries were important. From being a compact market town in the valley of the River Aire in the 16th century Leeds expanded and absorbed the surrounding villages to become a populous urban centre by the mid-20th century. Leeds has a population of around 781,700 (2016) making it the third largest city in the United Kingdom. The city lies within the United Kingdom's fourth-most populous urban area, with a population of 2.3\u00a0million. \n\nToday, Leeds has the most diverse economy of all the UK's main employment centres and has seen the fastest rate of private-sector jobs growth of any UK city and has the highest ratio of public to private sector jobs of all the UK's Core Cities. Leeds has the third-largest jobs total by local authority area with 480,000 in employment and self-employment at the beginning of 2015.

Henkel was surprised by how obsessed people are with taking pictures these days - before dinner, during friends' birthday parties, on museum tours and so on.You know people just like that, don't you? They keep taking pictures because they think that it helps record the moment, but as Henkel's latest study has just found out, this obsession may prevent their brains from remembering what actually happened, reported The Guardian. In her study, Henkel led a group of college students around a museum and asked them to simply observe 15 objects and to photograph 15 others.The next day the students' memory of the tour was tested, and the results showed that they were less accurate in recognizing the objects and they remembered fewer details about them if they photographed them. \"When people rely on technology to remember for them - counting on the camera to record the event and thus not needing to attend to it fully themselves, it can have a negative effect on how well they remember their experiences,\" Henkel explained. But there is also an exception: if students zoomed in to photograph part of an object, their memory actually improved, and those who focused the lens on a specific area could even recall parts that weren't in the frame. So basically, this study is saying that constantly taking pictures can harm your memory.But shouldn't reviewing pictures we have taken help wake up our memories? This is true, but only if we spend enough time doing it. \"In order to remember, we have to access and interact with the photos, rather than just amassing them,\" Henkel told The Telegraph.However, previous", "3qxnc7eipivf1gqfygdci16bnn390b_13": "Guardian.

His support of civil disobedience did little to endear him to his colleagues. Then, following the war, he directed his efforts toward reconciliation and improving international relations. And soon his politics were making it difficult for him to visit the United States, even to give lectures. \n\nEinstein's second great cause was Zionism . Although he was Jewish, Einstein rejected the idea of God. However, a growing awareness of anti-Semitism , both before and during the War, led him gradually to identify with the Jewish community, and later to become an outspoken supporter of Zionism. \n\nHis theories came under attack. One man was accused of motivating others to murder Einstein and fined a mere six dollars. When a book was published entitled 100 Authors Against Einstein, he retorted, \"If I were wrong, then one would have been enough!\" When Hitler came to power, Einstein then in America declared he would not return to Germany. While Nazi attacked his house and confiscated his bank account, a Berlin newspaper displayed the headline \"Good News from Einstein--He's Not Coming Back.\" \n\nFearing that German scientists would build a nuclear bomb, Einstein proposed that the United States should develop its own. But he was publicly warning of the dangers of nuclear war and proposing international control of nuclear weaponry. Throughout his life, Einstein's efforts toward peace probably achieved little and won him few friends. His support of the Zionist cause, however, was recognized in 1952, when he was offered the presidency of Israel. He declined, saying he was too naive in politics.

Although not universally accepted, it serves as the audio frequency reference for the calibration of acoustic equipment and the tuning of pianos, violins, and other musical instruments. \n\nPrior to the standardization on 440\u00a0Hz, many countries and organizations followed the French standard since the 1860s of 435\u00a0Hz, which had also been the Austrian government's 1885 recommendation. Johann Heinrich Scheibler recommended A440 as a standard in 1834 after inventing the \"tonometer\" to measure pitch, and it was approved by the the same year. \n\nThe American music industry reached an informal standard of 440\u00a0Hz in 1926, and some began using it in instrument manufacturing. In 1936 the American Standards Association recommended that the A above middle C be tuned to 440\u00a0Hz. This standard was taken up by the International Organization for Standardization in 1955 (reaffirmed by them in 1975) as ISO 16.
