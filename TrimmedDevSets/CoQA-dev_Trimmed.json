She shared her hay bed with her mommy and 5 other sisters. All of her sisters were cute and fluffy, like Cotton. But she was the only white one in the bunch. The rest of her sisters were all orange with beautiful white tiger stripes like Cotton's mommy. Being different made Cotton quite sad. She often wished she looked like the rest of her family.

When her mommy and sisters found her they started laughing. \n\n\"What are you doing, Cotton?!\" \n\n\"I only wanted to be more like you\". \n\nCotton's mommy rubbed her face on Cotton's and said \"Oh Cotton, but your fur is so pretty and special, like you. We would never want you to be any other way\". And with that, Cotton's mommy picked her up and dropped her into a big bucket of water. When Cotton came out she was herself again. Her sisters licked her face until Cotton's fur was all all dry. \n\n\"Don't ever do that again, Cotton!\" they all cried. \"Next time you might mess up that pretty white fur of yours and we wouldn't want that!\" \n\nThen Cotton thought, \"I change my mind.

About 15 unmarked cars could be seen on the street, as well as a Montgomery County police vehicle. \n\nSupervisory Special Agent Philip Celestini, who was at the residence, declined to comment further on the search, citing the active investigation. \n\nAruban Solicitor General Taco Stein said earlier Friday that the suspect will appear in court Monday, where an investigating magistrate could order him held for at least eight more days, order him to remain on the island or release him outright due to a lack of evidence. \n\nGiordano was arrested by Aruban police on August 5, three days after Robyn Gardner was last seen near Baby Beach on the western tip of the Caribbean island. \n\nGiordano told authorities that he had been snorkeling with Gardner when he signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement. When he reached the beach, Gardner was nowhere to be found, Giordano allegedly said. \n\nThe area that Giordano led authorities to is a rocky, unsightly location that locals say is not a popular snorkeling spot. \n\nAlthough prosecutors have continued to identify the 50-year-old American man by his initials, GVG, they also released a photo of a man who appears to be Giordano. His attorney, Michael Lopez, also has said that his client is being held as a suspect in Gardner's death. Lopez has not returned telephone calls seeking comment.

OCLC is funded mainly by the fees that libraries have to pay for its services (around $200\u00a0million annually ). \n\nOCLC began in 1967, as the Ohio College Library Center, through a collaboration of Ohio university presidents, vice presidents, and library directors who wanted to create a cooperative, computerized network for Ohio libraries. The group first met on July 5, 1967 on the campus of the Ohio State University to sign the articles of incorporation for the nonprofit organization. The group hired Frederick G. Kilgour, a former Yale University medical school librarian, to design the shared cataloging system. Kilgour wished to merge the latest information storage and retrieval system of the time, the computer, with the oldest, the library. The plan was to merge the catalogs of Ohio libraries electronically through a computer network and database to streamline operations, control costs, and increase efficiency in library management. The goal of this network and database was to bring libraries together to cooperatively keep track of the world's information to best serve researchers and scholars. The first library to do online cataloging through OCLC was the Alden Library at Ohio University on August 26, 1971.

To both the girl and the dog's surprise, there was a small brown bear resting in the bushes. The bear was not surprised and did not seem at all interested in the girl and her dog.

But they brought other things which touched her closely, and bridged the phantom-crowded space of anxiety with active sympathy in immediate trial.

She could not witness the silencing and excommunication of a man whose distinction from the great mass of the clergy lay, not in any heretical belief, not in his superstitions, but in the energy with which he sought to make the Christian life a reality, without feeling herself drawn strongly to his side. \n\nFar on in the hot days of June the Excommunication, for some weeks arrived from Rome, was solemnly published in the Duomo.

Reluctantly Archie unfastened the chain from the pole, and holding the end in his hand went round with Hector to the front of the pavilion. He was resolved that if under the dog's guidance the party came close up with Bruce, he would kill the dog and then try to escape by fleetness of foot, though of this, as there were so many mounted men in the party, he had but slight hope. Led by the peasant they proceeded to the hut, which was five miles away in the hills. On reaching it Hector at once became greatly excited. He sniffed here and there, eagerly hunted up and down the cottage, then made a circuit round it, and at last, with a loud deep bay he started off with his nose to the ground, pulling so hard at the chain that Archie had difficulty in keeping up with him. Pembroke and his knights rode a little behind, followed by their men-at-arms. \n\n\"I pray you, Sir Earl,\" Archie said, \"keep not too close to my traces, for the sound of the horse's hoofs and the

Gen. Bartolome Ramon Pineda Ortiz was named as the new army commander. Brig. Gen. Hugo Gilberto Aranda Chamorro and Rear Adm. Egberto Emerito Orie Benegas took over the top posts at the air force and navy, respectively. \n\nThe announcement came from the armed forces, not the president's office. \n\nCibar Benitez, commander of the armed forces, was the only top leader to retain his post. \n\nOther changes would be forthcoming in the lower ranks, said Benitez at the swearing-in ceremony, but he denied there was any truth to talk of a coup. \n\nParaguay's history is filled with unstable transitions of power since it emerged from dictatorship in 1989. Although there hasn't been a coup since that year, there were attempted coups in 1996 and 2000, and President Raul Cubas resigned amid controversy in 1999. \n\nThe military shakeup is the third since Lugo took office. The former Catholic bishop was elected to a five-year term last year. His victory brought an end to six decades of one-party rule in Paraguay, but the honeymoon did not last long. \n\nIn April, Lugo admitted that he fathered a child while he was still a priest and that he may have fathered more. The revelation, which came as a shock to most, hurt his political image. Calls for his resignation began, and have continued as Lugo has struggled to push reforms through a majority-opposition legislature.

T. PALGRAVE. \n\nWhen Anne Woodford began to wake from the constant thought of the grief and horror she had left at Portchester, and to feel more alive to her surroundings and less as if they were a kind of dream, in which she only mechanically took her part, one thing impressed itself on her gradually, and that was disappointment. If the previous shock had not blunted all her hopes and aspirations, perhaps she would have felt it sooner and more keenly; but she could not help realising that she had put herself into an inferior position whence there did not seem to be the promotion she had once anticipated. Her companion rockers were of an inferior grade to herself. Jane Humphreys was a harmless but silly girl, not much wiser, though less spoilt, than poor little Madam, and full of Cockney vulgarities. Education was unfashionable just then, and though Hester Bridgeman was bettor born and bred, being the daughter of an attorney in the city, she was not much better instructed, and had no pursuits except that of her own advantage. Pauline Dunord was by far the best of the three, but she seemed to live a life apart, taking very little interest in her companions or anything around her except her devotions and the bringing them over to her Church. The nursery was quite a separate establishment; there was no mingling with the guests of royalty, who were only seen in excited peeps from the window, or when solemnly introduced to the presence chamber to pay their respects to the Prince. As to books, the only secular one that Anne saw while at Whitehall was an odd volume of Parthenissa. The late King's summary of the Roman controversy was to be had in plenty, and nothing was more evident than that the only road to favour or promotion was in being thereby convinced.

The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital. \n\nZiad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. \"We were desperate,\" said Matouk. \n\nThe UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. \"We are very satisfied with the results,\" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital. \n\nSkaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians in transplant surgery at the Royal Liverpool. \"Funding is a problem,\" said Hammad. \"In the meantime we'll go back as volunteers to Gaza for the next couple of years to do more transplants.\" The Liverpool team's next visit is scheduled for May.", "qas": [{"id": "3var3r6g1p10qszov999867i2qqo8t_1", "question": "What is Adbelkader Hammad's job?", "answers": [{"text": "doctor", "answer_start": 798}, {"text": "doctor", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "doctor", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3var3r6g1p10qszov999867i2qqo8t_2", "question": "Where does he work?", "answers": [{"text": "at the Royal Liverpool hospital", "answer_start": 805}, {"text": "at the Royal Liverpool hospital", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "at the Royal Liverpool hospital", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3var3r6g1p10qszov999867i2qqo8t_3", "question": "Where is his family from?", "answers": [{"text": "Palestinian", "answer_start": 1210}, {"text": "Palestinian", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Palestine", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3var3r6g1p10qszov999867i2qqo8t_4", "question": "What did he and other doctors do for the first time?", "answers": [{"text": "carried out Gaza's first organ transplants", "answer_start": 31}, {"text": "carried out Gaza's first organ transplants", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "They carried out Gaza's first organ transplants", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3var3r6g1p10qszov999867i2qqo8t_5", "question": "On how many people?", "answers": [{"text": "Two patients", "answer_start": 153}, {"text": "Two patients", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Two", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3var3r6g1p10qszov999867i2qqo8t_6", "question": "What organs did they transplant?", "answers": [{"text": "kidney", "answer_start": 176}, {"text": "kidney", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "kidneys", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3var3r6g1p10qszov999867i2qqo8t_7", "question": "Were they donated by strangers or family?", "answers": [{"text": "The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation.

The Spaniards were joined by the allied forces of Venice and the Church under the condotta of the Marquis Gonzaga of Mantua, the leader of the Italians at Fornovo. \n\nLodovico had detached himself from the league, and again made terms with France for his own safety's sake.

Let me count the ways ... \n\nRyan Reynolds wonders if marrying his boss, Sandra Bullock, is a good thing in \"The Proposal.\" \n\nSomething old: The story of a haughty woman and an exasperated man who hate each other -- until they realize they love each other -- is proudly square, in the tradition of rom-coms from the 1940s and '50s. Or is it straight out of Shakespeare's 1590s? \n\nSandra Bullock is the shrew, Margaret, a pitiless, high-powered New York book editor first seen multitasking in the midst of her aerobic workout (thus you know she needs to get ... loved). Ryan Reynolds is Andrew, her put-upon foil of an executive assistant, a younger man who accepts abuse as a media-industry hazing ritual. \n\nAnd there the two would remain, locked in mutual disdain, except for Margaret's fatal flaw -- she's Canadian. (So is \"X-Men's\" Wolverine; I thought our neighbors to the north were supposed to be nice.) \n\nMargaret, with her visa expired, faces deportation and makes the snap executive decision to marry Andrew in a green-card wedding. It's an offer the underling can't refuse if he wants to keep his job. (A sexual-harassment lawsuit would ruin the movie's mood.) \n\nOK, he says. But first comes a visit to the groom-to-be's family in Alaska. Amusing complications ensue. \n\nSomething new: The chemical energy between Bullock and Reynolds is fresh and irresistible. In her mid-40s, Bullock has finessed her dewy America's Sweetheart comedy skills to a mature, pearly texture; she's lovable both as an uptight careerist in a pencil skirt and stilettos, and as a lonely lady in a flapping plaid bathrobe.

For international coordination, it is officially measured in meters, even by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States, as Canada and Mexico have extensive border zones where stations can be received on either side of the international boundaries. Stations that want to increase above a certain HAAT must reduce their power accordingly, based on the maximum distance their station class is allowed to cover (see List of North American broadcast station classes for more information on this). \n\nThe FCC procedure to calculate HAAT is: from the proposed or actual antenna site, either 12 or 16 radials were drawn, and points at 2, 4, 6, 8, and radius along each radial were used. The entire radial graph could be rotated to achieve the best effect for the station. The altitude of the antenna site, minus the average altitude of all the specified points, is the HAAT.

Outside on the open waste, the cold was almost too severe to face, and George once or twice glanced anxiously across the snowy levels, looking for some sign of Edgar, who should have joined them with the team and sledge. It was, however, difficult to see far, because a gray dimness narrowed in the horizon. George stood, dressed in snow-flecked furs, in the center of a little clearing strewn with rows of fallen trunks from which he was hewing off the branches. The work was hard; his whole body strained with each stroke of the heavy ax, but it failed to keep him warm, and the wind was growing more bitter with the approach of night. \n\n\"I don't know what can be keeping West,\" he said after a while. \"We haven't seen the mail-carrier either, and he's two hours late; but he must have had a heavy trail all the way from the settlement.

BRUCE AND THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE. \n\nThe position towards France of Edward I. made it really more desirable for him that Scotland should be independent and friendly, than half subdued and hostile to his rule. While she was hostile, England, in attacking France, always left an enemy in her rear. But Edward supposed that by clemency to all the Scottish leaders except Wallace, by giving them great appointments and trusting them fully, and by calling them to his Parliament in London, he could combine England and Scotland in affectionate union. He repaired the ruins of war in Scotland; he began to study her laws and customs; he hastily ran up for her a new constitution, and appointed his nephew, John of Brittany, as governor. But he had overlooked two facts: the Scottish clergy, from the highest to the lowest, were irreconcilably opposed to union with England; and the greatest and most warlike of the Scottish nobles, if not patriotic, were fickle and insatiably ambitious. It is hard to reckon how often Robert Bruce had turned his coat, and how often the Bishop of St Andrews had taken the oath to Edward. Both men were in Edward's favour in June 1304, but in that month they made against him a treasonable secret covenant. Through 1305 Bruce prospered in Edward's service, on February 10, 1306, Edward was conferring on him a new favour, little guessing that Bruce, after some negotiation with his old rival, the Red Comyn, had slain him (an uncle of his was also butchered) before the high altar of the Church of the Franciscans in Dumfries.

The country is located at the crossroads of main European cultural and trade routes. It is bordered by Italy to the west, Austria to the north, Hungary to the northeast, Croatia to the south and southeast, and the Adriatic Sea to the southwest. It covers and has a population of 2.06 million. It is a parliamentary republic and a member of the United Nations, European Union, and NATO. The capital and largest city is Ljubljana. \n\nThe territory is mostly mountainous with a mainly continental climate, with the exception of the Slovene Littoral that has a sub-Mediterranean climate and the north-western area that has an Alpine climate. Additionally, the Dinaric Alps and the Pannonian Plain meet on the territory of Slovenia. The country, marked by a significant biological diversity, is one of the most water-rich in Europe, with a dense river network, a rich aquifer system, and significant karst underground watercourses. Over half of the territory is covered by forest. The human settlement of Slovenia is dispersed and uneven. \n\nSlovenia has historically been the crossroads of West Slavic, South Slavic, Germanic, Romance, and Hungarian languages and culture. Although the population is not homogeneous, the majority is Slovene. South Slavic language Slovene is the official language throughout the country.

ecological state of a species being unique to a defined geographic location, such as an island, nation, country or other defined zone, or habitat type; organisms that are indigenous to a place are not endemic to it if they are also found elsewhere. The extreme opposite of endemism is cosmopolitan distribution. An alternative term for a species that is endemic is precinctive, which applies to species (and subspecific categories) that are restricted to a defined geographical area. \n\nThe word \"endemic\" is from New Latin \"end\u0113micus\", from Greek \u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, \"end\u0113mos\", \"native\". \"End\u0113mos\" is formed of \"en\" meaning \"in\", and \"d\u0113mos\" meaning \"the people\". The term \"precinctive\" has been suggested by some scientists, and was first used in botany by MacCaughey in 1917. It is the equivalent of \"endemism\". \"Precinction\" was perhaps first used by Frank and McCoy. \"Precinctive\" seems to have been coined by David Sharp when describing the Hawaiian fauna in 1900: \"I use the word precinctive in the sense of 'confined to the area under discussion' ... 'precinctive forms' means those forms that are confined to the area specified.\" That definition excludes artificial confinement of examples by humans in far-off botanical gardens or zoological parks. \n\nPhysical, climatic, and biological factors can contribute to endemism. The orange-breasted sunbird is exclusively found in the fynbos vegetation zone of southwestern South Africa. The glacier bear is found only in limited places in Southeast Alaska.

If you can't, don't feel too bad; neither could the middle school teacher in England who received this as homework. This is Netspeak: the language of computerized communication found on Internet or cell phones. To new comers, it can look like a completely foreign language. So, what is the translation of the sentence above? My summer holidays were a complete waste of time. Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face. I love New York. It's great. School teachers and parents say this new form of writing is harming the English language. Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes can be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted . \"Everyone should just relax\", say linguists . They believe Netspeak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing, has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nurberg, from Stanford University, agrees. \"People get better at writing by writing,\" he says. \"kids who are now doing text messaging, e-mails, and instant messages will write at least as well as, and possibly better than their parents.\" Linguist James says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can _ that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents. They too will think this way. James argues that languages do not and cannot become corrupted. They simply change to meet the new needs. However, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write standard English. Cynthia McVey says, \"I can understand Netspeak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but learning to write proper English is a must for their future.\" Perhaps we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway. Erin, aged 12, says, \"I wouldn't use text language in my homework.

A long line at Los Angeles International Airport's security checkpoint had kept him from getting to his gate on time. \n\nHis grandson Caden would be taken off life support in a matter of hours in Denver, Colorado, with or without his grandfather's presence, according to CNN affiliate KABC. \n\n\"I was kind of panicking because I was running late, and I really thought I wasn't going to make the flight,\" Dickinson told KABC. \n\nThat's when a pilot from Southwest Airlines stepped up and held the flight at the gate until Dickinson arrived. The pilot was standing by the air bridge waiting for him when Dickinson arrived in socks, so rushed that he just grabbed his shoes at security and ran through the terminal. \n\n\"I told him, 'Thank you so much. I can't tell you how much I appreciated that.' And he said, 'No problem. They can't leave without me anyway,'\"Dickinson told KABC. \n\nAuthorities say Dickinson's grandson, Caden Rodgers, suffered a head injury after his mother's boyfriend threw him across the room. The boyfriend reportedly told police he was drunk and high on marijuana at the time. The child later died and the boyfriend has been charged with first-degree murder, according to the Aurora Sentinel. \n\nThanks to the pilot, Dickinson made it to Colorado in time to say goodbye to his grandson. Most airlines would punish any staff member who holds up a flight, according to consumer advocate Christopher Elliott, who broke the story of the sympathetic pilot on his blog. However, a Southwest spokeswoman said the pilot's actions were praiseworthy. \n\n\"You can't hold a plane for every late customer, but I think we would all agree that these were extenuating circumstances and the pilot absolutely made the right decision,\" Southwest spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said. \"I don't think you could ask for a better example of great service for our customers.\"",

Barring a political miracle, Republican Ken Cuccinelli will be delivering a concession speech on Tuesday evening in Richmond. \n\nIn recent cycles, the Virginia race has been a key off-year barometer of national political sentiment. Four years ago, Republican Bob McDonnell won in blowout fashion, a victory that presaged the following year's GOP midterm wave. In 2005, Democrat Tim Kaine captured the governor's mansion, tapping into anxiety about President George W. Bush's handling of the Iraq War and Hurricane Katrina. \n\nNot so this year. The McAuliffe-Cuccinelli race has been defined by small-bore issues and character attacks rather than sweeping national concerns. \n\nBut despite the lack of late fireworks, there are plenty of crucial insights to be gleaned from the Virginia campaign. \n\nHere's what you need to know about this year's most important race: \n\n1. The 2012 playbook is still potent for Democrats \n\nMcAuliffe isn't exactly squeaky-clean. A longtime wheeler-dealer who has been less than forthcoming with his tax returns, \"the Macker\" has a history of eyebrow-raising business ventures that make for dangerous campaign fodder. The opposition research book on the former Democratic National Committee chairman is as thick a Virginia live oak. \n\nBut Democrats have successfully turned the race into a referendum on Cuccinelli, defining him over the summer as a right-wing zealot. A Washington Post poll last week showed that two-thirds of McAuliffe supporters said they were voting against Cuccinelli, rather than for McAuliffe.

Before then I had done bits of reviewing--novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine and anything I was asked to do for the radio. That was how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for television. He hired me, but Tom was not primarily a journalist, or he would certainly have been more careful in choosing his staff. \n\nAt first, his idea was that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialized knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film and radio. There would be a weekly lunch at which we would make our choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided we should cover, though there would also be guests to make the atmosphere sociable. \n\nIt all felt like a bit of dream at that time: a new newspaper and I was one of the team. It seemed so unlikely that a paper could be introduced into a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help me personally, and was pretending to employ me. Such was my lack of self-confidence. \n\nTom's original scheme for a team of critics for the arts never took off. It was a good idea, but we didn't get together as planned and so everything was done by phone. It turned out, too, that the general public out there preferred to associate a reviewer with a single subject area, and so I chose film. Without Tom's initial push, though, we would hardly have come up with the present arrangement, by which I write an extended weekly piece, usually on one film. \n\nThe space I am given allows me to broaden my argument--or forces me, in an uninteresting week, to make something out of nothing. But what is my role in the public arena? I assume that people choose what films to go to on the basis of the stars, the publicity or the director. So if a film review isn't really a consumer guide, what is it? I certainly don't feel I have a responsibility to be 'right' about a movie. Nor do I think there should be a certain number of 'great' and 'bad' films each year. All I have to do is put forward an argument.

The Cricket World Cup is played in this format. One Day International matches are also called Limited Overs Internationals (LOI), although this generic term may also refer to Twenty20 International matches. They are major matches and considered the highest standard of List A, limited overs competition. \n\nThe international one-day game is a late twentieth-century development. The first ODI was played on 5 January 1971 between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. When the first three days of the third Test were washed out officials decided to abandon the match and, instead, play a one-off one day game consisting of 40 eight-ball overs per side. Australia won the game by 5 wickets. ODIs were played in white kits with a red ball. \n\nIn the late 1970s, Kerry Packer established the rival World Series Cricket competition, and it introduced many of the features of One Day International cricket that are now commonplace, including coloured uniforms, matches played at night under floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens, and, for television broadcasts, multiple camera angles, effects microphones to capture sounds from the players on the pitch, and on-screen graphics. The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink, played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979. This led not only to Kerry Packer's Channel 9 getting the TV rights to cricket in Australia but also led to players worldwide being paid to play, and becoming international professionals, no longer needing jobs outside cricket. Matches played with coloured kits and a white ball became more commonplace over time, and the use of white flannels and a red ball in ODIs was finally abandoned in 2001.", "qas": [{"id":

Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin, while its largest conurbation is the Ruhr, with its main centres of Dortmund and Essen. The country's other major cities are Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, D\u00fcsseldorf, Leipzig, Bremen, Dresden, Hannover and Nuremberg. \n\nVarious Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before 100\u00a0AD. During the Migration Period, the Germanic tribes expanded southward. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the German Confederation was formed in 1815. The German revolutions of 1848\u201349 resulted in the Frankfurt Parliament establishing major democratic rights. \n\nIn 1871, Germany became a nation state when most of the German states unified into the Prussian-dominated German Empire. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918\u201319, the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic. In 1933 the Nazi seizure of power quickly led to the establishment of Nazi Germany which was built upon a dictatorship and consequently led to World War II and the Holocaust. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, two German states were founded: the democratic West Germany and the socialist East Germany.

During the GDR period, church membership was discouraged and has continued shrinking since the reunification in 1990. Today over two thirds of the population is non-religious. The Protestant Evangelical Church in Germany has had the largest number of members in the state, adhered to by 24.0% of the population in 2009.

Catholic regions are the Eichsfeld in the northwest and parts of the Rh\u00f6n Mountains around Geisa in the southwest. Protestant church membership is shrinking rapidly, whereas the Catholic Church is somewhat more stable because of Catholic migration from Poland, Southern Europe and West Germany.

For a pilot, the choice is very difficult. If he ejects, he is wise, but the plane crashes. If he stays in the plane, he risks his life. \n\nRecently, Chinese Air Force pilot Li Feng, 38, faced this choice during a training exercise. It was March 7 and he was flying a Jian-10 (Flghter-10) at 4,500 meters. A warning appeared on the plane's computer screen. He realized the plane might fail at any moment. \n\nLi Feng did a quick check of the engine and asked the base if he could return. When the fighter was 7km away from the airport, however, the engine stopped working. The plane began to fall at a speed of 25 meters a second from an altitude of 1,160 meters. \n\nUnder Air Force rules fighter pilots may eject if their aircraft loses engine power below 2,000 meters and can't be restarted. Before Li lost contact with the control tower, the commander in the air base asked him to eject. But Li Feng insisted on having another try. \n\n\"I knew where the deadline (to abandon the aircraft) was and was prepared for the ejection, but I decided not to give up unless the fighter was totally out of control,\" Li recalled during a recent television interview. \n\nAfter 104 seconds, Li was able to bring the fighter to a safe landing. The plane only suffered slight damage. \n\n\"You are a hero! Congratulations!\" Li's teacher, Xu yongling wrote in a text message to him after the landing. He said Li was a cool-headed pilot and very professional. \n\nLi's brave and calm act not only saved the 200 million yuan aircraft but also gave him invaluable first-hand experience of dealing with an engine emergency. \n\nFor his outstanding performance, the Air Force recently awarded him a gold medal.", "qas": [{"id": "3gu1kf0o4i11dq9wdl6yo829k14pb7_1", "question": "who was flying the plane?", "answers": [{"text": "Li Feng ", "answer_start": 504}, {"text": "Li Feng ", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Li Feng", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3gu1kf0o4i11dq9wdl6yo829k14pb7_2", "question": "from what country?", "answers": [{"text": "Chinese", "answer_start": 247}, {"text": "Chinese", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "China", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3gu1kf0o4i11dq9wdl6yo829k14pb7_3", "question": "his age?", "answers": [{"text": "38", "answer_start": 280}, {"text": "38", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "38", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3gu1kf0o4i11dq9wdl6yo829k14pb7_4", "question": "his profession?", "answers": [{"text": "pilot ", "answer_start": 265}, {"text": "pilot ", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "pilot", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3gu1kf0o4i11dq9wdl6yo829k14pb7_5", "question": "what kind of aircraft was he flying?", "answers": [{"text": "Jian-10", "answer_start": 365}, {"text": "Jian-10", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Jian-10", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3gu1kf0o4i11dq9wdl6yo829k14pb7_6", "question": "is that a passenger plane?", "answers": [{"text": "Jian-10 (Flghter-10)", "answer_start": 365}, {"text": "Jian-10 (Flghter-10)", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "No", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3gu1kf0o4i11dq9wdl6yo829k14pb7_7", "question": "is he in the military?", "answers": [{"text": " Chinese Air Force", "answer_start": 246}, {"text": " Chinese Air Force", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Yes", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3gu1kf0o4i11dq9wdl6yo829k14pb7_8", "question": "what branch?", "answers": [{"text": " Air Force ", "answer_start": 254}, {"text": " Air Force ", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Air Force", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3gu1kf0o4i11dq9wdl6yo829k14pb7_9", "question": "did he have a problem?", "answers": [{"text": "A warning appeared on the plane's computer screen.

So one day when Maxine and Thomas were swimming, Cindy did something mean. She threw rocks and Maxine and Thomas. Maxine's dad saw what happened and he was very mad. He went over and yelled at Cindy for what she did. After that Cindy didn't throw any rocks, and Maxine and Thomas could swim together and take lots of baths.

He, one of the wealthiest of its patricians, had furnished the vast sum which enabled old Nehushta to buy the coveted Pearl-Maiden in the slave-ring. Then his newly acquired property had been taken to this house, where he awaited her. This then was the end of their long rivalry; for this he, Caleb, had fought, toiled, schemed and suffered. Oh! rather than such a thing should be, in that dark hour of his soul, he would have seen her cast to the foul Domitian, for Domitian, at least, she would have hated, whereas Marcus, he knew, she loved. \n\nNow there remained nothing but revenge. Revenged he must be, but how? He might dog Marcus and murder him, only then his own life would be hazarded, since he knew well the fate that awaited the foreigner, and most of all the Jew, who dared to lift his hand against a Roman noble, and if he hired others to do the work they might bear evidence against him. Now Caleb did not wish to die; life seemed the only good that he had left. Also, while he lived he might still win Miriam--after his rival had ceased to live.

But some researchers say that is what persons from thirteen to nineteen years old are doing. While teenagers can look all grown up, studies have shown that their brains are still developing. How much this explains their behavior, though, is a subject of debate. Jay Giedd of America's National Institutes of Health is a leader in this area of research. Doctor Giedd has been studying a group of young people since 1991. They visit him every two years for imaging tests of their brains. He says considerable development continues in young people from the teenage years into the twenties. A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex appears especially undeveloped in teenagers. Researchers believe that this area controls judgment and consideration of risk. So, its underdevelopment may explain why young people seem more willing to take risks like driving too fast. Laurence Steinberg is a psychology professor at Temple University in Philadelphia. He says stronger laws and stronger parental control are needed to protect teens from themselves. That includes raising the age for driving. He says research shows that teenage brains are not fully equipped to control behavior. Other researchers, however, say there is not enough evidence to make a strong case for such findings. Psychologist Robert Epstein is a visiting scholar at the University of California in San Diego. Mr. Epstein notes that teen behavior differs from culture to culture. He says behavior depends for the most part on socialization. He believes that teenagers will demonstrate better, safer behavior if they spend more time with adults, and are treated more like them. But is that always true? Mike Males works at the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in San Francisco. He suggests that all of this talk lately about brainless teens could be an attempt to take away attention from the reality. Writing in the New York Times, he says it is middle-aged adults whose behavior has worsened. In his words, if grown-ups really have superior brains, why don't we act as if we do?", "qas": [{"id": "3qavnhz3em463vp6ffdvcg9jx96lay_1", "question": "What is a common saying that parents tell their kids?", "answers": [{"text": "Parents might tell older children to \"Act your age\"", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Parents might tell older children to \"Act your age\"", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "\"Act your age\"", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3qavnhz3em463vp6ffdvcg9jx96lay_2", "question": "Do scientists think it's accurate for parents to say this?", "answers": [{"text": "But some researchers say that is what persons from thirteen to nineteen years old are doing.", "answer_start": 53}, {"text": "But some researchers say that is what persons from thirteen to nineteen years old are doing.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "yes", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3qavnhz3em463vp6ffdvcg9jx96lay_3", "question": "Why do teens act immature when they appear to be grown up?", "answers": [{"text": "He says considerable development continues in young people from the teenage years into the twenties", "answer_start": 539}, {"text": "He says considerable development continues in young people from the teenage years into the twenties", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Brain development continues into their twenties", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3qavnhz3em463vp6ffdvcg9jx96lay_4", "question": "What area of the brain is still growing during this time?", "answers": [{"text": " A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex appears especially undeveloped in teenagers.", "answer_start": 639}, {"text": " A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex appears especially undeveloped in teenagers.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3qavnhz3em463vp6ffdvcg9jx96lay_5", "question": "What is its function?", "answers": [{"text": " Researchers believe that this area controls judgment and consideration of risk", "answer_start": 748}, {"text": " Researchers believe that this area controls judgment and consideration of risk", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "controls judgment and consideration of risk", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3qavnhz3em463vp6ffdvcg9jx96lay_6", "question": "What behaviors show this lack of development?", "answers": [{"text": " So, its underdevelopment may explain why young people seem more willing to take risks like driving too fast.", "answer_start": 828}, {"text": " So, its underdevelopment may explain why young people seem more willing to take risks like driving too fast.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "driving too fast", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3qavnhz3em463vp6ffdvcg9jx96lay_7", "question": "Do all scientists agree on this topic?", "answers": [{"text": "Other researchers, however, say there is not enough evidence to make a strong case for such findings.

Scott. And he's ideally suited to director Guy Ritchie's purpose, which is not to dust off your grandfather's Conan Doyle, but to juice today's kids with a quirky 19th century super sleuth. \n\nWhat's fun about these movies is that the equation works both ways. \n\nYes, this Holmes is more likely to get physical than his predecessors, he's even a bit of a boor, but he's still a more cerebral action hero than we find in most blockbusters, and the period trappings (a seamless blend of CGI and location work) help this franchise stand out from the crowd of comic book adaptations. \n\nRitchie and husband-and-wife screenwriters Kieran and Michele Mulroney (\"Paper Man\") map out a fast-moving -- if ridiculously digressive -- Victorian adventure that crisscrosses Europe by horseless carriage, train, boat, and, in Sherlock's case, pony. \n\nJust down the road from 221 Baker Street they're digging a tunnel for what will become the London Underground. The Industrial Age is beginning to stretch its muscles, while a series of terrorist atrocities are gnawing at the fragile understanding between the great European powers.

A surging mob of vacant and wondering peons, bearing a singular resemblance to the wild cattle and horses which intermingled with them in blind and unceasing movement across the Plaza and up the hilly street, and seemingly as incapable of self-government, were alternately dispersed and stampeded or allowed to gather again as occasion required.

When Richard Keene, who would not leave his sister until he had seen her safe under the Mission walls, ventured at her suggestion to ask after the American recluse, Father Esteban replied dryly that, being a Christian gentleman, Hurlstone was the only one who had the boldness to seek out the American filibuster Perkins, on his own ship, and remonstrate with him for his unholy crusade. For the old priest had already become aware of Hurlstone's blunder, and he hated Eleanor as the primary cause of the trouble. But for her, Diego would be still with him in this emergency.

Nominally a union of multiple equal national Soviet republics, its government and economy were highly centralized. The country was a one-party state, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. The Russian nation had constitutionally equal status among the many nations of the union but exerted de facto dominance in various respects. Other major urban centres were Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Alma-Ata and Novosibirsk. The Soviet Union was one of the five recognized nuclear weapons states and possessed the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. It was a founding permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, as well as a member of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the leading member of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) and the Warsaw Pact. \n\nThe Soviet Union had its roots in the October Revolution of 1917, when the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced Tsar Nicholas II during World War I. In 1922, the Soviet Union was formed with the unification of the Russian, Transcaucasian, Ukrainian, and Byelorussian republics. Following Lenin's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle, Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s. Stalin committed the state's ideology to Marxism\u2013Leninism (which he created), and initiated a centrally planned economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization. During this period of totalitarian rule, Stalin imposed political paranoia; the mid-1930s Great Purge removed his opponents within and outside of the party via arbitrary arrests and persecutions of many people. Suppression of political critics, forced labor, and famines were perpetrated by Stalin; in 1933, a major famine struck Soviet Ukraine, causing the deaths of over 7 million people.", "qas": [{"id": "3gdtjdapvubcqpecituwg2id7wk8mj_1", "question": "Who led the Bolsheviks?", "answers": [{"text": "when the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin,", "answer_start": 1130}, {"text": "when the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin,", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Vladimir Lenin,", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3gdtjdapvubcqpecituwg2id7wk8mj_2", "question": "What did they overthrow?", "answers": [{"text": " overthrew the Russian Provisional Government ", "answer_start": 1173}, {"text": " overthrew the Russian Provisional Government ", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Russian Provisional Government", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3gdtjdapvubcqpecituwg2id7wk8mj_3", "question": "Which had replaced the rule of whom?", "answers": [{"text": " which had replaced Tsar Nicholas II ", "answer_start": 1218}, {"text": " which had replaced Tsar Nicholas II ", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Tsar Nicholas II", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3gdtjdapvubcqpecituwg2id7wk8mj_4", "question": "When did the overthrow occur?", "answers": [{"text": "The Soviet Union had its roots in the October Revolution of 1917,", "answer_start": 1064}, {"text": "The Soviet Union had its roots in the October Revolution of 1917,", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "1917,", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3gdtjdapvubcqpecituwg2id7wk8mj_5", "question": "Who succeeded Lenin?", "answers": [{"text": " Following Lenin's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle, Joseph Stalin came to power", "answer_start": 1403}, {"text": " Following Lenin's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle, Joseph Stalin came to power", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Joseph Stalin", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3gdtjdapvubcqpecituwg2id7wk8mj_6", "question": "When?", "answers": [{"text": "Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s.", "answer_start": 1464}, {"text": "Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "the mid-1920s.", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3gdtjdapvubcqpecituwg2id7wk8mj_7", "question": "When was the Great Purge?", "answers": [{"text": " During this period of totalitarian rule, Stalin imposed political paranoia;

These were then handed over to the footmen, who, resplendent in gorgeous liveries of scarlet and azure, hurried along the marble passages carrying the masterpieces of culinary art to the banqueting-hall beyond, whilst the butlers, more sedate and dignified in sober garb of puce or brown, stalked along in stately repose bearing the huge tankards and crystal jugs. \n\nAll of the best that the fine old Ch\u00e2teau d'Aumont could provide was being requisitioned to-night, since M. le Duc and Mlle.

Most of the diary is a record of big events in Philadelphia. It also includes a description of British soldiers burning Washington, D.C. in the war of 1812. She describes President James Madison on horseback as \"perfectly shaking with fear\" during the troubled days. George Washington, she writes, mistook her for the wife of a French man, and praised her excellent English. The adventure of the lost book began September 4 when Cory Luxmoore arrived from England to deliver the diary of his ancestor to the Library Company, which he and his wife considered to be the best home for the diary. Green told American Libraries he had the diary in his possession \"about five minutes\" when Luxmoore took it back because he had promised to show it to one other person. On returning to his hotel after showing the precious book to Green, Luxmoore was shocked to realize that he had left it in the taxi. Without any delay, Green began calling every taxi company in the city, with no luck. \"I've felt sick since then,\" Luxmoore told reporters. According to Green, no one has yet learned how the diary came to the office building. Tom Brennan received a reward of $ 1,000, Philadelphia gained another treasure for its history, and Luxmoore told reporters, \"It's wonderful news.

is to blame. \n\nA Los Angeles coroner ruled that a surgical anesthetic called Propofol killed the then 50-year-old Jackson, in combination with several sedatives found in his blood, on June 25, 2009. \n\nEver since, there have been ongoing efforts -- from awards to statues to new songs -- to keep his memory, and music, alive. Still, much of the talk about one of the world's most celebrated singers has occurred in courtrooms, centered around a host of cases related to his untimely death. \n\nAuthorities claim that his personal doctor, Conrad Murray, administered the fatal dose. He has been charged with involuntary manslaughter in the singer's death. The doctor's defense attorney, Ed Chernoff, contends Jackson was \"a desperate man in many respects\" and gave himself the fatal dose of surgical anesthesia while the doctor was not watching. \n\nOne of Michael's sisters, LaToya Jackson, told CNN's Piers Morgan this week that her brother \"told me that they were going to murder him\" -- identifying \"they\" only as \"the people involved in his life, the people that were controlling him.\" \n\nThe late singer's father, Joe Jackson, also fingered unidentified individuals in an interview with CNN on Saturday. \n\n\"We're striving for justice, because there's more to it than they're claiming,\" said Joe Jackson, who has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Murray and also said he's still fighting over who controls his son's estate. \"There is somebody else involved.\" ", "qas": [{"id": "354p56de9k3bo6myslycebloo147sf_1", "question": "What year did MJ die?", "answers": [{"text": " 2009", "answer_start": 364}, {"text": " 2009", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "2009", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "354p56de9k3bo6myslycebloo147sf_2", "question": "What drug killed him?", "answers": [{"text": "Propofol", "answer_start": 249}, {"text": "Propofol", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Propofol", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "354p56de9k3bo6myslycebloo147sf_3", "question": "is it an OTC drug?", "answers": [{"text": "a surgical anesthetic c", "answer_start": 220}, {"text": "a surgical anesthetic c", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "No", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "354p56de9k3bo6myslycebloo147sf_4", "question": "What type is it?", "answers": [{"text": "a surgical anesthetic", "answer_start": 220}, {"text": "a surgical anesthetic", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "a surgical anesthetic", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "354p56de9k3bo6myslycebloo147sf_5", "question": "Who gave it to him?", "answers": [{"text": "Conrad Murray", "answer_start": 707}, {"text": "Conrad Murray", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Conrad Murray", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "354p56de9k3bo6myslycebloo147sf_6", "question": "How was e linked to MJ?", "answers": [{"text": "his personal doctor", "answer_start": 686}, {"text": "his personal doctor", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "his personal doctor", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "354p56de9k3bo6myslycebloo147sf_7", "question": "Did he get in trouble for it?", "answers": [{"text": " He has been charged with involuntary manslaughter in the singer's death.

As long as Buster didn't get his great paws on Danny, the latter was safe. Then, too, Danny is a very small person. He is so small that he can hide under two or three leaves.

He is one of the largest of the people who live in the Green Forest. Being so big, it is not easy to hide. \n\nMoreover, a hunter with a terrible gun does not have to get close in order to kill. Lightfoot knew all this as he waited for the coming of the hunter of whom Sammy Jay had warned him. He had learned many lessons in the hunting season of the year before and he remembered every one of them. He knew that to forget even one of them might cost him his life.

Douglas was a student in one of my calsses. (I have not used his real name for personal reasons. As he requested.) But here is his real story as he told it before one of our adult - education classes. He told us how tragedy had struck at his home, not once, but twice. The first time he had lost his five-old daughter, a child he adored. He and his wife thought they couldn't bear that first loss; but, as he said:\"Ten months later, God gave us another little girl and she died in five days.\" \n\nThis double \n\nwas almost too much to bear. \"I couldn't take it,\" this father told us. \"I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I couldn't rest or relax. My nerves were entirely shaken and my confidence gone.\" At last he went to doctors; one recommended sleeping pills and another recommended a trip. He tried both, but neither helped. He said:\"My body felt as if it was surrounded in a vice , and the jaws of the vice were being drawn tighter and tighter.\" The tension of grief ----if you have ever been paralyzed by sorrow, you know what he meant. \n\nBut thank God, I had one child left ----a four --year-- old son. He gave me the solution to my problem. One afternoon as I sat around feeling sorry for myself, he asked; 'Daddy, will you build a boat for me?' I was in no mood to build a boat; in fact, I was in no mood to do anything. But my son is a persistent little fellow! I had to give in. \n\nBuilding that toy boat took me about three hours. By the time it was finished, I realized that those three hours spent building that boat were first hours of mental relaxation and peace that I had had in months! I realized that it is difficult to worry while you are busy doing something that requires planning and thinking. In my case, building the boat had knocked worry out of the ring. So I determined to keep busy. \n\nThe following night, I went from room to room in the house, making a list of jobs that ought to be done. Scores of items needed to be repaired: bookcase, stair steps, storm windows, window-shades, locks, leaky taps. Amazing as it seems, in the course of two weeks I had made a list of 242 items that needed attention. \n\n\"During the last two years I have completed most of them. I am busy now that I have no time for worry.\" \n\nNo time for worry! That is exactly what Winston Churchill said when he was working eighteen hours a day at the height of the war. When he was asked if he worried about his huge responsibilities, he said :\"I am too busy. I have no time for worry.\"", "qas": [{"id": "3ekvh9qmey4y0g6apjmsnligcd6d2z_17", "question": "What quote by Churchill is included?", "answers": [{"text": "I am too busy.

She talked to hundreds of teachers and parents. \n\nOne of the many things that knocked my socks off, \" she says, \"was the consistency with which children -- whether they were 4 or 8 or 18 or 24-- talked about feeling exhausted and frustrated or mad trying to get their parents' attention, competing with computer screens or iPhone screens or any kind of technology.\" \n\nA couple of years ago, my daughter got a laptop for school. And because she was becoming more independent, we got her a phone. We set up rules for when she could use the device and when she'd need to put it away. We created a charging station, outside her bedroom, where she had to plug in these devices every night. Basically -- except for homework-- she has to put it all away when she comes home. \n\nSteiner-Adair says most adults don't set up similar limits in their own lives. \"We've lost the boundaries that protect work and family life,'' she says. \"So it is very hard to manage yourself and be present in the moments your children need you.'' \n\nAfter my daughter's little intervention ,I made myself a promise to create my own charging station.

There may be coral islands/cays on the rim. The coral of the atoll often sits atop the rim of an extinct seamount or volcano which has eroded or subsided partially beneath the water. The lagoon forms over the volcanic crater or caldera while the higher rim remains above water or at shallow depths that permit the coral to grow and form the reefs. For the atoll to persist, continued erosion or subsidence must be at a rate slow enough to permit reef growth upwards and outwards to replace the lost height. \n\nThe word \"atoll\" comes from the Dhivehi (an Indo-Aryan language spoken on the Maldive Islands) word \"atholhu\" (Dhivehi: , ), meaning an administrative subdivision. Its first recorded use in English was in 1625 as \"atollon\" \u2013 Charles Darwin recognized its indigenous origin and coined, in his \"The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs\", the definition of atolls as \"circular groups of coral islets\" that is synonymous with \"lagoon-island\". \n\nMore modern definitions of \"atoll\" describe them as \"annular reefs enclosing a lagoon in which there

Wool mainly consists of protein together with a few percent lipids. In this regard it is chemically quite distinct from the more dominant textile, cotton, which is mainly cellulose. \n\nWool is produced by follicles which are small cells located in the skin. These follicles are located in the upper layer of the skin called the epidermis and push down into the second skin layer called the dermis as the wool fibers grow. Follicles can be classed as either primary or secondary follicles. Primary follicles produce three types of fiber: kemp, medullated fibers and true wool fibers. Secondary follicles only produce true wool fibers. Medullated fibers share nearly identical characteristics to hair and are long but lack crimp and elasticity. Kemp fibers are very coarse and shed out. Wool's scaling and crimp make it easier to spin the fleece by helping the individual fibers attach to each other, so they stay together. Because of the crimp, wool fabrics have greater bulk than other textiles, and they hold air, which causes the fabric to retain heat.

may have been prevalent in Fitzgerald's mind when he was so defiant of the countess, it may be difficult to say. Probably he had no idea, but felt at the spur of the moment that it would be weak to yield. The consequence was, that when Lady Desmond left Hap House, he was obliged to consider himself as being at feud with the family. \n\nThe young lord he did see once again during the holidays, and even entertained him at Hap House; but the earl's pride would not give way an inch. \n\n\"Much as I like you, Owen, I cannot do anything but oppose it. It would be a bad match for my sister, and so you'd feel if you were in my place.\" And then Lord Desmond went back to Eton. \n\nAfter that they none of them met for many months. During this time life went on in a very triste manner at Desmond Court. Lady Desmond felt that she had done her duty by her daughter; but her tenderness to Clara was not increased by the fact that her foolish attachment had driven Fitzgerald from the place. As for Clara herself, she not only kept her word, but rigidly resolved to keep it. Twice she returned unopened, and without a word of notice, letters which Owen had caused to be conveyed to her hand.

Founded in 1847, and formerly self-styled as the \"World's Greatest Newspaper\" (for which WGN radio and television are named), it remains the most-read daily newspaper of the Chicago metropolitan area and the Great Lakes region. It is the eighth-largest newspaper in the United States by circulation (and became the second-largest under Tribune's ownership after the \"Chicago Tribune\"s parent company purchased the \"Los Angeles Times\"). \n\nTraditionally published as a broadsheet, on January 13, 2009, the \"Tribune\" announced it would continue publishing as a broadsheet for home delivery, but would publish in tabloid format for newsstand, news box, and commuter station sales. This change, however, proved to be unpopular with readers and in August 2011, the \"Tribune\" discontinued the tabloid edition, returning to its traditional broadsheet edition through all distribution channels. \n\nThe \"Tribune\"s masthead is notable for displaying the American flag, in reference to the paper's motto, \"An American Paper for Americans.\" The motto is no longer displayed on the masthead, where it was placed below the flag. \n\nThe \"Tribune\" was founded by James Kelly, John E. Wheeler, and Joseph K. C. Forrest, publishing the first edition on June 10, 1847. Numerous changes in ownership and editorship took place over the next eight years. Initially, the \"Tribune\" was not politically affiliated, but tended to support either the Whig or Free Soil parties against the Democrats in elections. By late 1853, it was frequently running xenophobic editorials that criticized foreigners and Roman Catholics. About this time it also became a strong proponent of temperance. However nativist its editorials may have been, it was not until February 10, 1855 that the \"Tribune\" formally affiliated itself with the nativist American or Know Nothing party, whose candidate Levi Boone was elected Mayor of Chicago the following month.", "qas": [{"id": "3atpcq38j8aq3uw5yu2l6obf6w8yah_1", "question": "Who founded the paper?", "answers": [{"text": "James Kelly, John E.

Originating in the steppes of Central Asia, the Mongol Empire eventually stretched from Eastern Europe to the Sea of Japan, extending northwards into Siberia, eastwards and southwards into the Indian subcontinent, Indochina, and the Iranian plateau, and westwards as far as the Levant. \n\nThe Mongol Empire emerged from the unification of nomadic tribes in the Mongol homeland under the leadership of Genghis Khan, whom a council proclaimed ruler of all the Mongols in 1206. The empire grew rapidly under his rule and that of his descendants, who sent invasions in every direction. The vast transcontinental empire connected the east with the west with an enforced \"Pax Mongolica\", allowing the dissemination and exchange of trade, technologies, commodities, and ideologies across Eurasia. \n\nThe empire began to split due to wars over succession, as the grandchildren of Genghis Khan disputed whether the royal line should follow from his son and initial heir \u00d6gedei or from one of his other sons, such as Tolui, Chagatai, or Jochi. The Toluids prevailed after a bloody purge of \u00d6gedeid and Chagataid factions, but disputes continued even among the descendants of Tolui. A key reason for the split was the dispute over whether the Mongol Empire would become a sedentary, cosmopolitan empire, or would stay true to their nomadic and steppe lifestyle. After M\u00f6ngke Khan died (1259), rival kurultai councils simultaneously elected different successors, the brothers Ariq B\u00f6ke and Kublai Khan, who then not only fought each other in the Toluid Civil War (1260\u20131264), but also dealt with challenges from descendants of other sons of Genghis. Kublai successfully took power, but civil war ensued as Kublai sought unsuccessfully to regain control of the Chagatayid and \u00d6gedeid families.", "qas": [{"id": "3iuzpwiu1o7sq2arvkxmf5tv0xokwz_1", "question": "When did Genghis Khan become ruler of Mongol?", "answers": [{"text": "1206", "answer_start": 703}, {"text": "1206", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "1206", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3iuzpwiu1o7sq2arvkxmf5tv0xokwz_2", "question": "Did his empire grow when he and his family ruled?", "answers": [{"text": "empire grew rapidly", "answer_start": 713}, {"text": "empire grew rapidly", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Yes.", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3iuzpwiu1o7sq2arvkxmf5tv0xokwz_3", "question": "What allowed trade with the east and west?", "answers": [{"text": "Pax Mongolica", "answer_start": 900}, {"text": "Pax Mongolica", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Pax Mongolica", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3iuzpwiu1o7sq2arvkxmf5tv0xokwz_4", "question": "How many sons did Khan have?", "answers": [{"text": "\u00d6gedei or from one of his other sons, such as Tolui, Chagatai, or Jochi", "answer_start": 1194}, {"text": "\u00d6gedei or from one of his other sons, such as Tolui, Chagatai, or Jochi", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "at least 4", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3iuzpwiu1o7sq2arvkxmf5tv0xokwz_5", "question": "Who was his original heir?", "answers": [{"text": "\u00d6gedei", "answer_start": 1194}, {"text": "\u00d6gedei", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "\u00d6gedei", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3iuzpwiu1o7sq2arvkxmf5tv0xokwz_6", "question": "What were the grandchildren arguing over?", "answers": [{"text": " the royal line should follow from his son and initial heir \u00d6gedei", "answer_start": 1134}, {"text": " the royal line should follow from his son and initial heir \u00d6gedei", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "If royal line should follow from his son and initial heir \u00d6gedei, or another.", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3iuzpwiu1o7sq2arvkxmf5tv0xokwz_7", "question": "What did their bickering cause to happen to the empire?", "answers": [{"text": "civil war", "answer_start": 1907}, {"text": "civil war", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "civil war", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3iuzpwiu1o7sq2arvkxmf5tv0xokwz_8", "question": "When was the Toluid Civil War?", "answers": [{"text": "1260\u20131264", "answer_start": 1785}, {"text": "1260\u20131264", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "1260\u20131264", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3iuzpwiu1o7sq2arvkxmf5tv0xokwz_9", "question": "Did it involve family versus family?", "answers": [{"text": " brothers Ariq B\u00f6ke and Kublai Khan, who then not only fought each other in the Toluid Civil War", "answer_start": 1687}, {"text": " brothers Ariq B\u00f6ke and Kublai Khan, who then not only fought each other in the Toluid Civil War", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "yes.", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3iuzpwiu1o7sq2arvkxmf5tv0xokwz_10", "question": "Who won?", "answers": [{"text": "Kublai", "answer_start": 1871}, {"text": "Kublai", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Kublai", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3iuzpwiu1o7sq2arvkxmf5tv0xokwz_11", "question": "Did it last, though?", "answers": [{"text": "unsuccessfully", "answer_start": 1941}, {"text": "unsuccessfully", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "no", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}]}]}, {"title": "", "paragraphs": [{"context": "This year marks the 100thanniversary of Leo Tolstoy's death.

Percy, the husband whom she loved with all the ardour which her admiration for his bravery had kindled, was in immediate, deadly peril, through her hand. She had betrayed him to his enemy--unwittingly 'tis true--but she HAD betrayed him, and if Chauvelin succeeded in trapping him, who so far was unaware of his danger, then his death would be at her door.

The Story Girl went up and told him wondrous tales; and Sara Ray brought him a pudding she had made herself.

In August it was a place of shady sweetness, fragrant with the odour of ripening apples, full of dear, delicate shadows. Through its openings we looked afar to the blue rims of the hills and over green, old, tranquil fields, lying the sunset glow. Overhead the lacing leaves made a green, murmurous roof. There was no such thing as hurry in the world, while we lingered there and talked of \"cabbages and kings.\" A tale of the Story Girl's, wherein princes were thicker than blackberries, and queens as common as buttercups, led to our discussion of kings. We wondered what it would be like to be a king. Peter thought it would be fine, only kind of inconvenient, wearing a crown all the time.

The Assembly had no powers to initiate primary legislation until limited law-making powers were gained through the Government of Wales Act 2006.

The Royal Commission on the Constitution (the Kilbrandon Commission) was set up in 1969 by Harold Wilson's Labour Government to investigate the possibility of devolution for Scotland and Wales. Its recommendations formed the basis of the 1974 White Paper \"Democracy and Devolution: proposals for Scotland and Wales\", which proposed the creation of a Welsh Assembly.

University of Texas. Abigail Fisher, a white woman, argues that she has been a victim of the university's race-conscious admission policies; the university contends that its drive for racial and ethnic diversity is educationally enriching -- a benefit to all students. \n\nWill the ugly discourse that generally characterizes debate over racially preferential policies disappear with the wave of a magic Supreme Court wand? It seems unlikely. The issue is a cat with many more than nine lives. It arrived in the early 1970s and, despite many attacks, some of which have taken the form of amendments to state constitutions, it has survived in pretty fine fettle. \n\nThe court will have only eight justices to hear the arguments. Elena Kagan, having been involved in the case as solicitor general in the Obama administration, has bowed out of participation. Her absence, however, leaves five justices likely to express at least some degree of skepticism about the racial preferences given to non-Asian minorities in the admissions process. \n\nHas the University of Texas been enriched by academic diversity? Maybe. But equally likely is the possibility that racial double standards reinforce stereotypes about smart whites and even smarter Asians. There are certainly wide gaps in the average SAT scores between blacks and Hispanics, on the one hand, and whites and Asians, on the other hand. \n\nAmong freshmen entering the University of Texas in 2009 who did not fall into the top 10% of their high school class (automatic admission at the university), Asians scored at the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT takers nationwide, whites at the 89th percentile, Hispanics at the 80th percentile and blacks at the 52nd percentile. Startling? No. This picture has been well known for a long time. Heartbreaking, yes, because the numbers mean the underperforming minority students are being woefully ill served by the K-12 school system. Moreover, arriving at institutions of higher education with an academic disadvantage, they do not catch up, as it has become clear.

They move smoothly with the help of small electric motors, or servos, commonly used by hobbyists in model airplanes. \n\nBuilt from lightweight materials, the robots are about the size of a human arm or smaller. They can sense which way is up, but are only as good as their human operators, Choset added. \n\nSam Stover, a search term manager with the Federal Emergency Management Agency based in Indiana, said snake-type robots would offer greater mobility than equipment currently available, such as cameras attached to extendable roles. \n\n\"It just allows us to do something we've not been able to do before,\" Stover said, \"We needed them yesterday.\" \n\nHe said snifter dogs are still the best search tool for rescue workers, but that they can only be used effectively when workers have access to damaged building. \n\nStover, among the rescue workers who handled the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, said snake robots would have helped rescuers search flooded houses in that disaster. \n\nChoset said the robots may not be ready for use for another five to ten years, depending on funding.", "qas": [{"id": "3c2nj6jbkah7msxned0vjquaqh12nz_1", "question": "Who uses snakes to save lives?", "answers": [{"text": "But Howie Choset sees in their delicate movements a way to save lives.

The Spike Lee film \"Do the Right Thing,\" critics and columnists said, would provoke violence and disrupt race relations. \n\nSpike Lee: \"I wanted to do a film that would try to show what was happening at the time.\" \n\n\"This movie is dynamite under every seat,\" wrote Newsweek's Jack Kroll. \n\nOther commentators believed the film would harm the candidacy of David Dinkins, an African-American who was running for mayor of New York. It might even spark riots at movie theaters, they thought. \n\nInstead, what the film provoked was ... talk. There were no riots. Dinkins was elected. \"Do the Right Thing\" had a successful run at the box office -- if not as successful as Lee and his supporters hoped -- and was nominated for two Academy Awards. \n\nTwenty years later, the film still maintains a hold on the imagination. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked it as one of the 100 best American films. Roger Ebert, who has written he cried when he first saw the film at the Cannes Film Festival, still considers the film a wonder: \"Spike Lee had done an almost impossible thing. He'd made a movie about race in America that empathized with all the participants,\" he wrote in 2001. \n\nSo what is the thing about \"Do the Right Thing?\" Watch Spike Lee describe things in his own words \u00bb \n\nPart of its staying power is in its boldness, both in look and action. Lee's first two films, \"She's Gotta Have It\" (1986) and \"School Daze\" (1988), had marked him as a rising young filmmaker. But it was \"Do the Right Thing,\" made when Lee was just 32, that showcased his confidence, from the deliberately striking color scheme (bright reds and oranges that make a hot day seem even hotter) to its heightened -- sometimes stagy -- atmosphere, to its grim, documentary-style riot climax.

THE VELVET COACH \n\n\n\nNo, my good Lord, Diana-- ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL \n\nA late autumn journey from the west coast to Paris was a more serious undertaking in the sixteenth century than the good seaman Master Hobbs was aware of, or he would have used stronger dissuasive measures against such an undertaking by the two youths, when the elder was in so frail a state of health; but there had been a certain deceptive strength and vigour about young Ribaumont while under strong excitement and determination, and the whole party fancied him far fitter to meet the hardships than was really the case. Philip Thistlewood always recollected that journey as the most distressing period of his life. \n\nThey were out of the ordinary highways, and therefore found the hiring of horses often extremely difficult. They had intended to purchase, but found no animals that, as Philip said, they would have accepted as a gift, though at every wretched inn where they had to wait while the country was scoured for the miserable jades, their proposed requirements fell lower and lower. Dens of smoke, dirt, and boorishness were the great proportion of those inns, where they were compelled to take refuge by the breaking down of one or other of the beasts, or by stress of weather. Snow, rain, thaw and frost alternated, each variety rendering the roads impassable; and at the best, the beasts could seldom be urged beyond a walk, fetlock-deep in mire or water. Worse than all, Berenger, far from recovered, and under the heavy oppression of a heartrending grief, could hardly fail to lose the ground that he had gained under the influence of hope. The cold seemed to fix itself on the wound on his cheek, terrible pain and swelling set in, depriving him entirely of sleep, permitting him to take no nourishment but fragments of soft crumbs soaked in wine or broth--when the inns afforded any such fare--and rendering speech excessively painful, and at last unintelligible.

It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region. \n\nA region's climate is generated by the climate system, which has five components: atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere. \n\nThe climate of a location is affected by its latitude, terrain, and altitude, as well as nearby water bodies and their currents. Climates can be classified according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme was the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. The Thornthwaite system, in use since 1948, incorporates evapotranspiration along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying biological diversity and how climate change affects it. The Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region. \n\nPaleoclimatology is the study of ancient climates. Since direct observations of climate are not available before the 19th century, paleoclimates are inferred from proxy variables that include non-biotic evidence such as sediments found in lake beds and ice cores, and biotic evidence such as tree rings and coral. Climate models are mathematical models of past, present and future climates. Climate change may occur over long and short timescales from a variety of factors; recent warming is discussed in global warming. Global warming results in redistributions. For example, \"a 3\u00b0C change in mean annual temperature corresponds to a shift in isotherms of approximately 300\u2013400 km in latitude (in the temperate zone) or 500 m in elevation.

It was really a very good newspaper, if small in size, and related the news of the day as promptly as the great New York journals did. \n\nArthur Weldon had not been very enthusiastic about the paper at any time, although he humored the girls by attending in a good-natured way to the advertising, hiring some of the country folk to get subscriptions, and keeping the books. He was a young man of considerable education who had inherited a large fortune, safely invested, and therefore had no need, through financial necessity, to interest himself in business of any sort. He allowed the girls to print his name as editor in chief, but he did no editorial work at all, amusing himself these delightful summer days by wandering in the woods, where he collected botanical specimens, or sitting with Uncle John on the lawn, where they read together or played chess. Both the men were glad the girls were happy in their work and enthusiastic over the success of their audacious venture. Beth was developing decided talent as a writer of editorials and her articles were even more thoughtful and dignified than were those of Patsy. The two girls found plenty to occupy them at the office, while Louise did the reportorial work and flitted through Millville and down to Huntingdon each day in search of small items of local interest.

They walked along the road one day and stopped to pick flowers for their mother. Jack picked a handful of red flowers. \"Mom is going to love these!\" he said. Jenny picked a handful of purple flowers. \"These are perfect for mother,\" She thought. Alice picked two handfuls of yellow flowers. \"Yellow flowers are so pretty for mom's kitchen,\" she said. John looked and looked, but couldn't find any blue flowers. He looked along the road, but there were no blue flowers. He looked by the stream, but there were no blue flowers. He was very sad. They walked along the road toward home to give their flowers to their mother. John walked very slowly and hung his head because he didn't have any flowers to give his mother. As they neared their home, John saw a small bunch of blue flowers growing near the fence. He was so happy he picked them all and rushed to catch up with his brother and sisters. When they got home they gave their mother all the flowers they had picked. She thanked them and put them on her kitchen table. \"I have the most thoughtful children in the world,\" She said.", "qas": [{"id": "3qxnc7eipivf1gqfygdci16bnvn90b_1", "question": "How many children were there?", "answers": [{"text": "there were four children.", "answer_start": 17}, {"text": "there were four children.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Four.", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3qxnc7eipivf1gqfygdci16bnvn90b_2", "question": "What was John's favorite color?", "answers": [{"text": "John's favorite color was blue.", "answer_start": 86}, {"text": "John's favorite color was blue.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Blue.", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3qxnc7eipivf1gqfygdci16bnvn90b_3", "question": "And Jack's?", "answers": [{"text": "Jack's favorite color was red.", "answer_start": 118}, {"text": "Jack's favorite color was red.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Red.", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3qxnc7eipivf1gqfygdci16bnvn90b_4", "question": "Jenny's?", "answers": [{"text": "Jenny's favorite color was purple ", "answer_start": 149}, {"text": "Jenny's favorite color was purple ", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Purple .", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3qxnc7eipivf1gqfygdci16bnvn90b_5", "question": "And Alice's?", "answers": [{"text": "Alice's favorite color was yellow.", "answer_start": 187}, {"text": "Alice's favorite color was yellow.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Yellow.", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3qxnc7eipivf1gqfygdci16bnvn90b_6", "question": "Where'd they walk?", "answers": [{"text": "They walked along the road ", "answer_start": 222}, {"text": "They walked along the road ", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Along the road", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3qxnc7eipivf1gqfygdci16bnvn90b_7", "question": "Who had trouble finding their favorite color?", "answers": [{"text": "John looked and looked, but couldn't find any blue flowers.

Johnson, making his first start since injuring his ankle in January, opened the scoring in the ninth minute while captain Carlos Tevez doubled the Blues' advantage on the quarter hour from the penalty spot. \n\nSecond-half strikes from David Silva, Patrick Vieira and Yaya Toure completed the rout as City went above reigning champions Chelsea into third in the standings. \n\nThey are six points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham, who pipped them for the final Champions League place last season, but have played a game more. \n\nLeaders Manchester United have a seven-point lead over Arsenal, who have played a game less, with their neighbors City 10 points adrift. \n\nThe strikes from Johnson, who exchanged passes with Toure before finishing neatly, and Tevez, who was fouled by Michael Turner to draw the penalty, effectively ended the match as a contest with City always in command against a Sunderland side in poor recent form. \n\nSilva scored after a Mario Balotelli shot was blocked, Vieira with his first touch after coming off the bench and Toure after an error by Sunderland captain Lee Cattermole. \n\nCity's Dutch international Nigel de Jong said the result was important for

But he felt that he simply had got to speak his mind to someone, so he swam across to where he had seen Peter Rabbit almost every night since Paddy began to build.

You can't see them because they are under water, and there is a passage from each right up through that platform of mud and sticks, which is the foundation of the house. It really is a very fine foundation, Peter; it really is. But what I can't understand is what Paddy is thinking of by building that great pile of mud right in the middle. When he gets his walls built, where will his bedroom be? There won't be any room at all. It won't be a house at all--just a big useless pile of sticks and mud.

They both were born in wealthy families and were active in politics for many years. Both men loved the sea and the navy,history and nature. \n\nRoosevelt and Churchill first met when they were lowerlevel officials in World War One. But neither man remembered much about that meeting. However,as they worked together during the Second World War they came to like and trust each other. Roosevelt and Churchill exchanged more than one thousand seven hundred letters and messages during five and a half years. They met many times,at large national gatherings and in private talks. But the closeness of their friendship might be seen best in a story told by one of Roosevelt's close advisors,Harry Hopkins. Hopkins remembered how Churchill was visiting Roosevelt at the White House one day. Roosevelt went into Churchill's room in the morning to say hello. But the president was shocked to see Churchill coming from the washing room with no clothes at all. Roosevelt immediately apologized to the British leader for seeing him naked. But Churchill reportedly said: \"The Prime Minister of Great Britain has nothing to hide from the president of the United States.\" And then both men laughed. \n\nThe United States and Great Britain were only two of several nations that joined together in the war to resist Hitler and his Allies. In January,1942,twentysix of these nations signed an agreement promising to fight for peace,religious freedom,human rights,and justice. The three major Allies,however,were the most important for the war effort: the United States,Britain,and the Soviet Union. Yet,Churchill and Roosevelt disagreed about when to attack Hitler in western Europe. And Churchill resisted Roosevelt's suggestions that Britain give up some of its colonies.

Movie rights are already spoken for by Chernin Entertainment, the studio behind \"Oblivion\" and \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,\" and critics are raving about Pessl's multimedia storytelling approach, which takes readers beyond the novel's pages to explore the story of a mysterious director and the washed-up reporter out to expose him. \n\nPessl's fictional mash-up of Stanley Kubrick, Roman Polanski and David Lynch hasn't been seen in public for 30 years. His movies are so frightening no theater will show them; his cult of fans meet in abandoned buildings and underground tunnels for secret screenings. \n\nInvestigative journalist Scott McGrath tried to expose Cordova years ago and it backfired, costing him his job, marriage and reputation. When Cordova's daughter turns up dead in an apparent suicide, McGrath sees an opportunity to exact revenge against the man he blames for his downfall. \n\nPessl weaves into the narrative excerpts from magazine articles, newspaper headlines, police reports, crime scene photos and screen shots of online message boards. She also wrote and directed several short films being featured over the next few weeks on YouTube that offer clues into the book's mystery, including snippets and trailers from Cordova's films.

She sang and danced her way to the top of the box office in such films as Bright Eyes, Curly Top and Heidi. By 1940, she had appeared in 43 films. Temple teamed with Bill Robison in four movies, and their dance on the stairs in The Little Colonel is still a legendary film moment. \n\nIn the 1930s, her name on a movie introduction assured a packed house. She inspired dolls, dresses, dishes--even a drink (alcohol-free, of course). \n\nUS President Franklin D. Roosevelt once famously said that \"as long as our country has Shirley Temple, we will be all right.'' \n\nUnlike so many of today's child stars, Temple didn't end up with her name appearing across the headlines for bad behaviors. Instead of getting her photos on front pages or struggling with drugs and alcohol, Temple went on to a second career in diplomacy , including presidential appointments as ambassador to Ghana. \n\nShe surprised a lot of people who doubted her with her grace, knowledge and eagerness to serve. In fact, her career in public service (20 years) was longer than her career in movies (19). The role she valued most, however, was as wife, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother. \n\nThe world has lost a treasured Hollywood legend.

Malleville was very unwilling to have Phonny climb up upon such a high tree, but Phonny himself was very desirous to make the attempt. There was a log fence at the foot of the tree, and the distance was not very great from the uppermost log of the fence, to the lowermost branch of the tree. So Phonny thought that he could get up without any difficulty. \n\nMalleville was afraid to have him try, and she said that if he did, he would be acting just as foolish as the boy that Beechnut had told them about, who nipped his own nose; and that she should not stop to see him do any such foolishness. So she walked along as fast as she could go. \n\nPhonny unfortunately was rendered only the more determined to climb the tree by Malleville's opposition. He accordingly mounted up to the top of the fence, and thence reaching the lower branches of the tree he succeeded at length, by dint of much scrambling and struggling, in lifting himself up among them. He climbed out to the limb where he had seen the appearances of a bird's nest, but found to his disappointment that there was no bird's nest there.

Barack Obama had just been elected president as Casillas was leaving the work force. \n\nNearly four years later, as Obama seeks reelection, Casillas has finally landed his first full-time job, emerging out of the group known as the long-term unemployed. \n\nThe Labor Department's July employment figures on Friday showed the average duration of unemployment shrank from 39.9 weeks in June to 38.8 weeks in July. The percentage of people who are unemployed long-term (27 weeks or longer) shrank from 41.9% in June to 40.7% in July. \n\nCasillas says his life is evidence that the economy is beginning to turn around. But the road to his new job was painful, heartbreaking and financially devastating. \n\nJuly jobs report: Hiring picks up, unemployment rises \n\nHe remembers his life pre-November 2008: He wore expensive suits, drove a Mercedes and spent every cent of his paycheck. When he was laid off, he thought he'd be back at work in two weeks. \n\nHe was wrong. \n\nThe subprime mortgage crisis was eating away at the U.S. economy. Employers were shedding jobs, not adding them. A few credits shy of his associate degree, Casillas found himself overqualified for many jobs but underqualified for higher-paid middle-class ones. \n\n\"Overqualified, what does that mean?\" Casillas remembers. \"They kept telling me that. Meanwhile, my life is going down the drain.\" \n\nHe lost his house, his Mercedes, and then his wife left him. In his 40s, he was forced to take the humiliating step of moving in with his mother. A year after he lost his job, he began selling everything he owned on Craigslist.

Its swimsuit issue, which has been published since 1964, is now an annual publishing event that generates its own television shows, videos and calendars. \n\nThere were two magazines named \"Sports Illustrated\" before the current magazine began on August 16, 1954. In 1936, Stuart Scheftel created \"Sports Illustrated\" with a target market for the sportsman. He published the magazine from 1936 to 1938 on a monthly basis. The magazine was a life magazine size and focused on golf, tennis, and skiing with articles on the major sports. He then sold the name to Dell Publications, which released \"Sports Illustrated\" in 1949 and this version lasted 6 issues before closing. Dell's version focused on major sports (baseball, basketball, boxing) and competed on magazine racks against \"Sport\" and other monthly sports magazines. During the 1940s these magazines were monthly and they did not cover the current events because of the production schedules. There was no large-base, general, weekly sports magazine with a national following on actual active events. It was then that \"Time\" patriarch Henry Luce began considering whether his company should attempt to fill that gap. At the time, many believed sports was beneath the attention of serious journalism and did not think sports news could fill a weekly magazine, especially during the winter.

Let's take a look, shall we? \n\nLast year, Sandra Bullock won Best Actress -- just days after taking home a Razzie -- for playing Leigh Anne Tuohy, the Southern mom who took in Michael Oher and helped coach him toward football greatness.

What went wrong? \n\nThe joy, spontaneity and humor of Robin Williams likely masked the daily torment he endured in his on-again-off-again struggle with depression. He made us laugh out here, but he was in pain in there. Unfortunately, I know that pain. \n\nIn his death, we have lost one of the most talented and creative spirits on the planet. Still, his death by suicide should be a wake-up call for us all. It is to remind us that many of us are walking a fine line -- smiling on the outside while slowly dying on the inside. \n\nI didn't know Robin personally, so I am unable to speak with any certainty as to why he chose to end his life. But I have experienced that kind of torment and pain. For years, I, too, struggled with depression. And many days, I still do. \n\nComplete coverage on Robin Williams \n\nThose who are suffering will do just about anything not to feel the pain anymore. And in those moments, their brains become their worst enemies. It often takes an outside force to provide light, to make sure those dark thoughts aren't, as in the case of Robin, our last thoughts. \n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Center, suicide rates increased from 2000 to 2011 from 10.4 deaths per 100,000 to 12.3 deaths per 100,000. \n\nThe rate of suicide is higher and rising among men.

Linda, 25, had a lot to do at work, plus visitors on the way: her parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown. But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Linda felt weak and tired -- maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks. \n\nSeveral yards away, Frank, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying. \n\nBut when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, \"Oh, my God, she fell in!\"Frank didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. \"No ! Not you ! \"his girlfriend screamed after him. \n\nShe was right to be alarmed. By the time Frank reached Linda, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station. \n\nIt was hard to lift her. She was just out. But he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the arms and drag her away from the edge. That was where Linda briefly regained consciousness, felt herself being pulled along the ground, and saw someone else holding her purse. \n\nLinda thought she'd been robbed. A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head. And she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in. \n\nPolice and fire officials soon arrived, and Frank told the story to an officer. Jennifer said her boyfriend was calm on their 40minute train ride downtown--just as he had been seconds after the rescue, which made her think about her reaction at the time. \"I saw the train coming and I was thinking he was going to die, \" she explained.", "qas": [{"id": "3qecw5o0kh1xg2lutso5qw3ez865tu_1", "question": "How old is Linda?", "answers": [{"text": " Linda, 25", "answer_start": 23}, {"text": " Linda, 25", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "25", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3qecw5o0kh1xg2lutso5qw3ez865tu_2", "question": "was she early?", "answers": [{"text": "Linda was kind of late", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Linda was kind of late", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "no", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3qecw5o0kh1xg2lutso5qw3ez865tu_3", "question": "who was coming to visit?", "answers": [{"text": "her parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown", "answer_start": 86}, {"text": "her parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "her parents", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3qecw5o0kh1xg2lutso5qw3ez865tu_4", "question": "how did she feel walking down?", "answers": [{"text": "feel uncomfortably warm", "answer_start": 207}, {"text": "feel uncomfortably warm", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "uncomfortably warm", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3qecw5o0kh1xg2lutso5qw3ez865tu_5", "question": "and later?", "answers": [{"text": "felt weak and tired", "answer_start": 275}, {"text": "felt weak and tired", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "weak and tired", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3qecw5o0kh1xg2lutso5qw3ez865tu_6", "question": "what did she lean against?", "answers": [{"text": "She rested herself against a post close to the tracks.

the west where they join Plymouth Sound to form the boundary with Cornwall. \n\nPlymouth's early history extends to the Bronze Age, when a first settlement emerged at Mount Batten. This settlement continued as a trading post for the Roman Empire, until it was surpassed by the more prosperous village of Sutton, now called Plymouth. In 1620, the Pilgrim Fathers departed Plymouth for the New World and established Plymouth Colony \u2013 the second English settlement in what is now the United States of America. During the English Civil War the town was held by the Parliamentarians and was besieged between 1642 and 1646. \n\nThroughout the Industrial Revolution, Plymouth grew as a commercial shipping port, handling imports and passengers from the Americas, and exporting local minerals (tin, copper, lime, china clay and arsenic) while the neighbouring town of Devonport became a strategic Royal Naval shipbuilding and dockyard town. In 1914 three neighbouring independent towns, viz., the county borough of Plymouth, the county borough of Devonport, and the urban district of East Stonehouse were merged to form a single County Borough. The combined town took the name of Plymouth which, in 1928, achieved city status. The city's naval importance later led to its targeting and partial destruction during World War II, an act known as the Plymouth Blitz. After the war the city centre was completely rebuilt and subsequent expansion led to the incorporation of Plympton and Plymstock along with other outlying suburbs in 1967.", "qas": [{"id":

routine: drop her child off at school. \n\nThe last time her 7-year-old son, Richie, was in class was on December 14, when a gunman smashed his way into his school in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 26 children and adults. \n\nAs shots rang out, Richie's teacher locked the door and huddled her students into the corner as the shooter roamed the hallways, wielding an AR-15 assault rifle and firing. \n\nWhen it appeared safe, the children were then hurried away to a nearby fire station, where teary parents either reunited with their sons and daughters or learned that they had been killed. \n\nNearly a month later, Wilford said her son still has trouble sleeping and is often scared by loud noises. \n\nNewtown chooses faith, charity, hope \n\nBut on Thursday, he will join hundreds of other Newtown students returning to class for the first time since the tragedy. \n\n\"We think it's good he's going back,\" Wilford said. \"If I leave my child anywhere, I'm leaving a piece of my heart, so it's difficult to leave him.\" \n\n'I think I'll be OK,' Sandy Hook student says after first day \n\nBut Richie apparently isn't afraid and says he's looking forward to seeing his friends, she said. \n\nThey won't be attending Sandy Hook Elementary, which police say remains part of an ongoing investigation into Adam Lanza, the gunman who also killed his mother before opening fire at the school.

"(CNN)As art, film stills are often overlooked. \n\nThe photographers tend to be anonymous; it's easy to imagine their work done by the director or cinematographer. Their images are often lumped in with the promotional machinery: Whether documenting the stars frolicking on set or getting down to business, it's just another form of salesmanship. \n\nWhich is why the work of Ernst Haas is so striking. \n\nHaas, one of the 20th century's great photojournalists and image-makers -- an early member of the great Magnum Photos cooperative who was famous enough in his prime to have been the subject of a Museum of Modern Art exhibit in 1962 -- was also a regular on movie sets. It was a necessity in those early days, said John Jacob, the editor of a new book of Haas' movie photography, \"Ernst Haas: On Set.\" \n\n\"Working on film sets was really important to Magnum, and all of the photographers working with Magnum in the '50s did films,\" says Jacob, now the McEvoy Family Curator for Photography at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Not only did the work pay off financially, but the photographers also established relationships with members of the industry, he said. \n\nAnd the stars and directors knew what they were getting: some of the best in the field. Photographers such as Haas were entrusted to bring their talent and style to the work. \n\nThe photographers \"are definitely producing work for posterity, that very much has their own fingerprint on it,\" Jacob said. \n\nSuch distinction is obvious from looking at Haas' work -- some of which is as famous as the movies he worked on.

In the 17th and 18th centuries Leeds became a major centre for the production and trading of wool. \n\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, Leeds developed into a major mill town; wool was the dominant industry but flax, engineering, iron foundries, printing, and other industries were important. From being a compact market town in the valley of the River Aire in the 16th century Leeds expanded and absorbed the surrounding villages to become a populous urban centre by the mid-20th century. Leeds has a population of around 781,700 (2016) making it the third largest city in the United Kingdom. The city lies within the United Kingdom's fourth-most populous urban area, with a population of 2.3\u00a0million. \n\nToday, Leeds has the most diverse economy of all the UK's main employment centres and has seen the fastest rate of private-sector jobs growth of any UK city and has the highest ratio of public to private sector jobs of all the UK's Core Cities. Leeds has the third-largest jobs total by local authority area with 480,000 in employment and self-employment at the beginning of 2015. Leeds is also ranked as a gamma world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network; and is considered the cultural, financial and commercial heart of the West Yorkshire Urban Area. Leeds is served by four universities, and has the fourth largest student population in the country and has the country's fourth largest urban economy.", "qas": [{"id": "3uxuoq9okex7oa04blcltbri2x27as_1", "question": "What city referred to a wooded area?", "answers": [{"text": "Leeds can be traced to the 5th century, when the name referred to a wooded area", "answer_start": 100}, {"text": "Leeds can be traced to the 5th century, when the name referred to a wooded area", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Leeds", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3uxuoq9okex7oa04blcltbri2x27as_2", "question": "What kingdom was this area in?", "answers": [{"text": "wooded area of the Kingdom of Elmet", "answer_start": 168}, {"text": "wooded area of the Kingdom of Elmet", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "the Kingdom of Elmet", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3uxuoq9okex7oa04blcltbri2x27as_3", "question": "In what country is it?", "answers": [{"text": "Leeds is a city in West Yorkshire, England", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Leeds is a city in West Yorkshire, England", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "England", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3uxuoq9okex7oa04blcltbri2x27as_4", "question": "What part?", "answers": [{"text": "Leeds is a city in West Yorkshire, England", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Leeds is a city in West Yorkshire, England", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "West Yorkshire", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3uxuoq9okex7oa04blcltbri2x27as_5", "question": "When did wool trade become popular?", "answers": [{"text": "In the 17th and 18th centuries Leeds became a major centre for the production and trading of wool.

The walking catfish found in Southeast Asia can stay on land for hours at a time, while lungfish found in Australia, Africa and South America can live out of water, but only in a not active way. But no other known fish can be out of water as long as the Mangrove Rivulus and keep active, according to Patricia Wright, a biologist at a Canadian University.

That means letting children get a little dirty might be good for their health later in life. \n\nThe study involved laboratory mice. It found that adult mice raised in a germ-free environment were more likely to develop allergies, asthma and other autoimmune disorders. There are more than eighty disorders where cells that normally defend the body instead attack tissues and organs. \n\nRichard Blumberg,who led the study,is a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston,Massachusetts. He says,in 1989,medical researchers who sought to explain these diseases, first discovered that the increasing use of antibacterial soaps and other products, especially early in life, could weaken immune systems. \n\nNow, Dr. Blumberg and his team have what is the first biological evidence to link early exposure to germs to stronger adult immune systems. They say this exposure could prevent the development of some autoimmune diseases. \n\nIn the adult germ-free mice, they found that inflammation in the lungs and colon was caused by so-called killer T cells. These normally fight infection. But they became overactive and targeted healthy tissue--an autoimmune condition seen in asthma and a disease called ulcerative colitis . \n\nDr. Blumberg says the mice raised in a normal environment did not have the same reaction. He says their immune systems had been \"educated\" by early exposure to germs. \n\nRates of autoimmune disorders are rising worldwide, but mostly in wealthier, industrialized countries. According to Dr. Blumberg, it might be high time that people were warned to be more careful with the early use of antibiotics and the prescription from their doctors. \n\nRob Dunn is a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. He says the new study does not mean people should stop washing. \"Wash your hands , but don't do it with antibacterial soap. Let your kids play in a reasonable amount of dirt and get outside and get exposed to a diversity of things\", says Rob Dunn.", "qas": [{"id": "3wz36bjev3gz5i23u2fiti3694dbtm_1", "question": "Are kids

Carver's first step was to analyze plant parts to find out what they were made of. He then combined these simpler isolated substances with other substances to create new products. \n\nThe branch of chemistry that studies and finds ways to use raw materials from farm products to make industrial products is called chemurgy. Carver was one of the first and greatest chemurgists of all time. Today the science of chemurgy is better known as the science of synthetics . Each day people depend on and use synthetics made from raw materials. All his life Carver battled against the disposal of waste materials, and warned of the growing need to develop substitutes for the natural substances being used up by humans. \n\nCarver never cared about getting credit for the new products he created. He never tried to patent his discoveries or get wealthy from them. He turned down many offers to leave Tuskegee Institute to become a scientist in private industry. Thomas Edison, inventor of the electric light, offered him a laboratory in Detroit to carry out food research.

MIs are less commonly caused by coronary artery spasms, which may be due to cocaine, significant emotional stress, and extreme cold, among others.

ability to transport them into a world of rhythm and melody. Recently more and more hospitals and clinics have been _ the power of music -not only to comfort patients, but to help cure them as well. Welcome to the world of music therapy . \n\nAfter each of the two world wars, musicians visited hospitals and played instruments for injured soldiers suffering from emotional and physical pain. Today's music therapists continue this practice, playing instruments such as guitars and harps to bring comfort to their audiences. \n\nTherapist Eric Mammen encourages his patients at a children's hospital to participate with him as he plays. During visits with 13-year-old cancer patient Lawrence Garcia, Mammen encourages Garcia to beat on electric drums while he plays the guitar. The therapy won't cure his cancer, but it does, according to Garcia's mom, take away much of the boy's depression . \n\nMusic therapy can put patients in better moods and ease the symptoms of depression according to the American Music Therapy Association. Other benefits include relieving pain, calming tension, aiding sleep, reducing worry or fear, and easing muscle tension. \n\nJose Haro personally experienced the benefits of music therapy when he was recovering from heart surgery. During his recovery, he played a piano whose keys lit up, indicating which keys to touch to play along with the background music. Soon he was playing tunes and noticing something strange. \"I was searching for my pain.\" He says of his experience, \"but it was gone.\" \n\nWhile Haro's experience provides an evidence of the power of music to relieve pain, scientific research has proven music also helps patients with Alzheimer's disease and arthritis. \n\nIn addition, music therapy helps premature babies. Doctors are tapping into a powerful way to teach premature babies that haven't yet learned how to suck. Doctors use a device that comforts the babies by playing music when they suck on a pacifier . Soon the babies learn to suck in return for music, gaining weight faster and going home earlier than those who do not use the device. \n\nEven perfectly healthy people are discovering the power of music to calm and heal. Drum circles attract people who find stress relief in beating out rhythms. While music is not a cure-all, it does make life a little easier.", "qas": [{"id": "3b3wtrp3db2mxqttd3hq1pzqlss92f_1", "question": "What profession is Eric Mammen in?", "answers": [{"text": "Therapist Eric Mammen encourages his patients at a children's hospital to participate with him as he plays.

Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here \"work\" refers to an author's work as a whole. The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year. The academy announces the name of the chosen laureate in early October.

Many authors who have won the prize have fallen into obscurity, while others rejected by the jury remain widely studied and read, like Ruben Dar\u00edo.

Tim Parks has expressed skepticism that it is possible for \"Swedish professors ...

They keep taking pictures because they think that it helps record the moment, but as Henkel's latest study has just found out, this obsession may prevent their brains from remembering what actually happened, reported The Guardian. In her study, Henkel led a group of college students around a museum and asked them to simply observe 15 objects and to photograph 15 others.The next day the students' memory of the tour was tested, and the results showed that they were less accurate in recognizing the objects and they remembered fewer details about them if they photographed them. \"When people rely on technology to remember for them - counting on the camera to record the event and thus not needing to attend to it fully themselves, it can have a negative effect on how well they remember their experiences,\" Henkel explained. But there is also an exception: if students zoomed in to photograph part of an object, their memory actually improved, and those who focused the lens on a specific area could even recall parts that weren't in the frame. So basically, this study is saying that constantly taking pictures can harm your memory.But shouldn't reviewing pictures we have taken help wake up our memories? This is true, but only if we spend enough time doing it. \"In order to remember, we have to access and interact with the photos, rather than just amassing them,\" Henkel told The Telegraph.However, previous research has shown that most people never take the time to look over their digital pictures simply because there are too many of them and they aren't usually very organized on their

But these days, the hunter has become the hunted, because of better methods from commercial fishermen who are looking for fins to make expensive soup sold mostly in Asia. Shark fins are far more valuable than shark meat, so fishermen cut the fins off live fish and throw the sharks overboard to maximize the catch they bring back. \n\nShark finning is illegal in the United States, but there're tournament sport fishermen, who target and kill the biggest ones they take from the sea. These tournaments, the prizes of which can reach $5,000 or more, attract large crowds of anglers but also draw protests from animal rights groups and environmentalists. \n\nThe competitors say they are enjoying a fun and legal sport, the impact on the overall shark population is very small, and most of the sharks caught are returned to the ocean. Dave Johnson, who is from Kennebunkport, Maine, said no one ever comes close to the limit set by the government of killing one shark per day during the three-month season. \n\n\"I enjoy watching these animals, but I also enjoy catching and releasing them, and very rarely killing them and eating them,\" he said. \"If I thought killing one shark was endangering the species and contributing to their decline I'd stop doing it tomorrow.\" \n\nThat is exactly what marine biologists like Luke Tipple want to happen. \"I believe that they should just stop it. In fact, we don't need to be targeting, in any way, any of these threatened populations,\" he said.

A noisy outburst of boys' laughter in the distance caused him to crouch suddenly down, his claws thrust into the ground for purchase, his muscles tense springs for the leap he knew not in what direction, from the danger he knew not what that might threaten him. Then he identified the noise, know that no harm impended, and resumed his stealthy advance on the Irish terrier. \n\nWhat might have happened there is no telling, for at that moment Bashti's eyes chanced to rest on the golden puppy for the first time since the capture of the _Arangi_.

He has worked with lyricist Bernie Taupin as his songwriting partner since 1967; they have collaborated on more than 30 albums to date. In his five-decade career Elton John has sold more than 300million records, making him one of the best-selling music artists in the world. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits, including seven consecutive No. 1 US albums, 58 \"Billboard\" Top 40 singles, 27 Top 10, four No. 2 and nine No. 1. For 31 consecutive years (1970\u20132000) he had at least one song in the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. His tribute single, re-penned in dedication to the late Princess Diana, \"Candle in the Wind 1997\" sold over 33million copies worldwide and is the best-selling single in the history of the UK and US singles charts. He has also composed music, produced records, and has occasionally acted in films. John owned Watford Football Club from 1976 to 1987, and 1997 to 2002. He is an honorary Life President of the club, and in 2014 had a stand named after him at the club's home stadium. \n\nRaised in the Pinner area of London, John learned to play piano at an early age, and by 1962 had formed Bluesology. John met his songwriting partner, Bernie Taupin, in 1967, after they had both answered an advert for songwriters.

But these were not just the isolated actions of a scientist dragged into the world of politics. Einstein's life was, in fact, \"divided between politics and equations .\" \n\nSickened by what he saw as the waste of human lives during the First World War, he became involved in antiwar demonstrations. His support of civil disobedience did little to endear him to his colleagues. Then, following the war, he directed his efforts toward reconciliation and improving international relations. And soon his politics were making it difficult for him to visit the United States, even to give lectures. \n\nEinstein's second great cause was Zionism . Although he was Jewish, Einstein rejected the idea of God. However, a growing awareness of anti-Semitism , both before and during the War, led him gradually to identify with the Jewish community, and later to become an outspoken supporter of Zionism. \n\nHis theories came under attack. One man was accused of motivating others to murder Einstein and fined a mere six dollars. When a book was published entitled 100 Authors Against Einstein, he retorted, \"If I were wrong, then one would have been enough!\" When Hitler came to power, Einstein then in America declared he would not return to Germany. While Nazi attacked his house and confiscated his bank account, a Berlin newspaper displayed the headline \"Good News from Einstein--He's Not Coming Back.\" \n\nFearing that German scientists would build a nuclear bomb, Einstein proposed that the United States should develop its own. But he was publicly warning of the dangers of nuclear war and proposing international control of nuclear weaponry. Throughout his life, Einstein's efforts toward peace probably achieved little and won him few friends. His support of the Zionist cause, however, was recognized in 1952, when he was offered the presidency of Israel. He declined, saying he was too naive in politics. But perhaps his real reason was different:\" Equations are more important to me, because politics is for the present, but an equation is something for eternity.\"", "qas": [{"id":

A few shots were heard, but they were only fired in rejoicing by the Royalists, and while Steadfast was studying his barley field, already silvered over by its long beards, and wondering how soon it would be ripe, and how he should get it cut and stacked, his name was shouted out, and he saw Tom Oates and all the rest of the boys scampering down the lane. \n\n\"Come along, Stead Kenton, come on and see, the Parliament soldiers come out and go by.\" \n\nPoor Steadfast had not much heart for watching soldiers, but it struck him that he might see or hear something of Jephthah, so he came with the other boys to the bank, where from behind a hedge they could look down at the ranks of soldiers as they marched along, five abreast, the road was not wide enough to hold more. They had been allowed to keep their weapons, so the officers had their swords, and the men carried their musquets. Most of them looked dull and dispirited, and the officers had very gloomy, displeased faces.

A lot of us standing outside. \n\nSuddenly came a dull, crashing sound from the school-room. At the ominous interruption I shuddered involuntarily, and called to Smithsye:-- \n\n\"What's up, Smithums?\" \n\n\"Guy's cleaning out the fourth form,\" he replied. \n\nAt the same moment George de Coverly passed me, holding his nose, from whence the bright Norman blood streamed redly. To him the plebeian Smithsye laughingly:-- \n\n\"Cully! how's his nibs?\" \n\nI pushed the door of the school-room open. There are some spectacles which a man never forgets. The burning of Troy probably seemed a large-sized conflagration to the pious Aeneas, and made an impression on him which he carried away with the feeble Anchises. \n\nIn the centre of the room, lightly brandishing the piston-rod of a steam-engine, stood Guy Heavystone alone. I say alone, for the pile of small boys on the floor in the corner could hardly be called company. \n\nI will try and sketch him for the reader. Guy Heavystone was then only fifteen. His broad, deep chest, his sinewy and quivering flank, his straight pastern, showed him to be a thoroughbred. Perhaps he was a trifle heavy in the fetlock, but he held his head haughtily erect. His eyes were glittering but pitiless. There was a sternness about the lower part of his face,--the old Heavystone look,--a sternness, heightened, perhaps, by the snaffle-bit which, in one of his strange freaks, he wore in his mouth to curb his occasional ferocity. His dress was well adapted to his square-set and herculean frame. A striped knit undershirt, close-fitting striped tights, and a few spangles set off his figure; a neat Glengarry cap adorned his head. On it was displayed the Heavystone crest, a cock regardant on a dunghill or, and the motto, \"Devil a better!\" ", "qas": [{"id": "3qjoxow4xjrtzqo3vwgw8cezi0yem6_1", "question": "What sound came from the school room?", "answers": [{"text": " came a dull, crashing sound from the school-room.", "answer_start": 197}, {"text": " came a dull, crashing sound from the school-room.", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "A dull, crashing sound.", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3qjoxow4xjrtzqo3vwgw8cezi0yem6_2", "question": "Did the author react to it?", "answers": [{"text": "I shuddered involuntarily,", "answer_start": 276}, {"text": "I shuddered involuntarily,", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Yes.", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3qjoxow4xjrtzqo3vwgw8cezi0yem6_3", "question": "What did he do?", "answers": [{"text": " I shuddered involuntarily", "answer_start": 275}, {"text": " I shuddered involuntarily", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Shuddered involuntarily.", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3qjoxow4xjrtzqo3vwgw8cezi0yem6_4", "question": "Did he ask anyone about the ruckus?", "answers": [{"text": "\"What's up, Smithums?\" ", "answer_start": 331}, {"text": "\"What's up, Smithums?\" ", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Yes.", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3qjoxow4xjrtzqo3vwgw8cezi0yem6_5", "question": "Who?", "answers": [{"text": "\"What's up, Smithums?\" ", "answer_start": 331}, {"text": "\"What's up, Smithums?\" ", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Smithums.", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3qjoxow4xjrtzqo3vwgw8cezi0yem6_6", "question": "How old was Guy Heavystone at the time?", "answers": [{"text": " Guy Heavystone was then only fifteen", "answer_start": 1110}, {"text": " Guy Heavystone was then only fifteen", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Fifteen.", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "3qjoxow4xjrtzqo3vwgw8cezi0yem6_7", "question": "Did he have a small, shallow chest?", "answers": [{"text": ".

She had two dogs, a brother, a sister, and a mom and dad. Every day she woke up and went to kindergarten, played outside, and watched movies. Sometimes her family would go to a rollercoaster park. Her mom would always try to get her to ride the big rides but she was afraid and wanted to stay in Snoopyland. For two years she stayed in the little kid section of the park. Her big brother who had to babysit her was getting mad because she would not try new rides. She cried more and more until one day she got brave. She went on a little bigger musical ride that went around in circles pretty fast. She got off the ride and loved it! Her mom said to her, \"Okay, let's go on the big kid rides now!\" Megan was afraid again and cried and cried. For the rest of that summer she stayed in the little kid section and went on little rides. The next summer her brother brought his girlfriend home. His girlfriend's name was Sara and she was older, and loved big rides. Megan liked Sara a lot and wanted to make her like her. When Sara asked Megan if she would ride on bigger rides she said yes, and she went on her first real rollercoaster, Thunderhawk. She was frightened at first but when she stepped off the ride she loved it like she had loved the other ride last year! Now was the real test. Sara asked Megan if she wanted to go on the biggest ride in the park. She was afraid but wanted to show Sara how big she was.

Monet was particularly interested in the effect of light and would paint the same scene in different lighting conditions or times of the day. For example, he painted around 20 versions of the Rouen Cathedral from dawn to dusk. His most famous paintings include his Water lilies series. \n\nThe paintings of Paul Cezanne had a lot of influence in the development of 20th century art, including Cubism and Fauvism . Cezanne is one of the most famous French artists and is known as a \"post-impressionist\", which was similar in some ways to impressionism but also broke away from some of its limitations. Famous French paintings include his Bathers and Mont St Victoire series. \n\nHenri Matisse was one of the most important famous French artists of the 20th century. He was considered one of the leaders of the Fauvist movement. He had a long and varied artistic career, painting in different styles ranging from Impressionism to Abstract. In 1941, Matisse was diagnosed with cancer and was forced into a wheelchair. But this didn't stop him completing the amazing Chapel of the Rosary in Vence. \n\nDegas is probably one of the most fascinating of all the famous French artists.

My grandfather was sitting in the backyard, reading. \"Hey, you look like you need some fun,\" he said. \"Want to go fishing?\" I said sure, and he went to the garage. He came out with two poles, some hooks, and some fishing line. Everything was in pieces, but he showed me how to put it all together. I asked if we needed worms, and he said no. Then, we set off to the river. \n\nIt was only about ten blocks to the river, but walking along past the library and the store, he told me about how he used to go fishing with his friend Steve. They used to catch catfish, then take them home so that their mothers could cook them for dinner.

toured an open air exhibit in Nassau's Rawson Square Sunday, before boarding a speedboat for a visit to several Bahamian islands to meet with locals. \n\nThe prince is expected to attend military exercises conducted by the Royal Bahamian Defence Force, responsible for patrolling about 1,000 islands in its 100,000 square miles of territorial waters. \n\nAfter a youth rally in the Bahamas National Stadium Monday, Harry travels to Jamaica and then on to Brazil to complete his 10-day tour. \n\nCNN's Brian Vitagliano contributed to this report. \n\n", "qas": [{"id":

presidents of Georgia and Poland came under fire, calling the claims \"a provocation\" meant to destabilize the region. \n\nGeorgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, said there were \"unpredictable people\" in the area. \n\n\"This is a real provocation,\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told journalists on Monday. \"It is not the first time that such things have happened: First they mastermind everything themselves and then accuse the Russian or the Ossetian side.\" \n\nEduard Kokoity, president of the breakaway region of South Ossetia, added: \"Today's event was a deliberate provocative act of the Georgian and Polish presidents targeted at regional destabilization.\" \n\nKokoity made his comments to the Russian news agency, Interfax. \n\nThe motorcade, carrying Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili and Polish President Lech Kaczynski, was passing a checkpoint near Georgia's breakaway South Ossetia region -- site of intense conflict between Russian and Georgian

Unlike some other forms of indoor football, the game is played on a hard court surface delimited by lines; walls or boards are not used. Futsal is also played with a smaller ball. The surface, ball, and rules create an emphasis on improvisation, creativity, and technique as well as ball control and passing in small spaces. \n\n\"Futsal\" comes from Spanish \"f\u00fatbol sala or f\u00fatbol de sal\u00f3n\" and from Portuguese \"futebol de sal\u00e3o\". The term is commonly translated as \"indoor football\" but a more literal translation is \"hall/lounge football\". During the sport's second world championships held in Madrid in 1985, the Spanish name \"f\u00fatbol sala\" was used. Since then, all other names have been officially and internationally changed to \"futsal\".

drones and U.S. Special Operations Forces -- and Brennan has been central to Obama's policy. \n\nIn an April 30 speech at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, Brennan laid out the rationale for the drone policy in more detail than any administration official had done publicly hitherto. He asserted that the drone strikes are legal both under the Authorization for Use of Military Force passed by Congress after the September 11 attacks and because, \"There is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for this purpose or that prohibits us from using lethal force against our enemies outside of an active battlefield, at least when the country involved consents or is unable or unwilling to take action against the threat.\" \n\nThis does not appear to be the view of Ben Emmerson, U.N. special rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights, who announced plans at Harvard Law School in October to launch an investigation into U.S. drone attacks and the extent to which they cause civilian casualties. \n\nPolitics: Compared to Hagel, reaction to Brennan nomination muted \n\nOne of Brennan's most significant legacies in the four years he has been the president's principal adviser on terrorism is the U.S. drone campaign against al Qaeda and its allies in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen -- one that has shifted focus significantly in the past year or so.

But finding the city wasn't that easy. During the summer, he and his 40 helpers dug at 35 different spots. The only things they found were ground spiders, giant ticks, and deadly snakes. \n\nJust before Thanksgiving says Clapp, _ \n\nBut then Clapp's team looked at the high-tech maps again and saw something surprising. Many of the caravan routes on the high-tech maps came together on the same spot marked \"Omani Marketplace\" on Ptolomy's map. Two maps, made almost 2000 years apart, pointed the team toward the same area! \n\nIn December 1991, Clapp arrived at the spot where, according to the maps, the caravans met. Clapp had a handheld instrument that could detect objects below the ground. It showed ruins under the sand! He and his team started digging. And then they found it! A tower buried in the sand. They slowly unearthed a giant, eight-sided fortress . It had nine towers and many rooms. People had lived in this fortress 2000 years ago. Outside its walls, they had found buried remains of nearly 40 campsites.

The Oxford Dictionary suggests the name to be a blend of the words gene and chromosome. However, see omics for a more thorough discussion. A few related -ome words already existed\u2014such as biome, rhizome, forming a vocabulary into which genome fits systematically. \n\nSome organisms have multiple copies of chromosomes: diploid, triploid, tetraploid and so on. In classical genetics, in a sexually reproducing organism (typically eukarya) the gamete has half the number of chromosomes of the somatic cell and the genome is a full set of chromosomes in a diploid cell. The halving of the genetic material in gametes is accomplished by the segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. In haploid organisms, including cells of bacteria, archaea, and in organelles including mitochondria and chloroplasts, or viruses, that similarly contain genes, the single or set of circular or linear chains of DNA (or RNA for some viruses), likewise constitute the genome. The term genome can be applied specifically to mean what is stored on a complete set of nuclear DNA (i.e., the \"nuclear genome\") but can also be applied to what is stored within organelles that contain their own DNA, as with the \"mitochondrial genome\" or the \"chloroplast genome\".

The main part of the building has large, arched windows, a jeweled four-sided clock and ticket windows. Grand Central has been seen in many movies through the years. Dan Brucker is with the New York Transit Authority, which operates the station. Dan Brucker has worked for the transit authority at Grand Central for 30 years. In all those years, he has not lost his interest in the building. Justin Ferate, a historian, has been giving tours of Grand Central Station for 30 years. He says the station was designed to make travel a pleasure. \"Why people don't run into each other in Grand Central is simple: each block of stone in Grand Central is the length of your leg. Each block of stone in Grand Central is the length of your arm. Each block of stone is a different color, so it's a checkerboard, based on you.\" A ten-year-long fight against plans to build a huge office building over Grand Central in 1968 helped create the modern preservation movement.

Diagnosed with diabetes , Thomas would need to inject himself with insulin three times a day for the rest of his life or risk nerve damage, blindness, and even death. And if that weren't bad enough, he had no health insurance. After a month of feeling upset, Thomas decided he'd better find a way to fight back. He left Canton, Michigan for New York, got a job waiting tables, nicknamed himself the Diabetic Rockstar , and created diabeticrockstar.com, a free online community for diabetics and their loved ones--a place where over 1,100 people share personal stories, information, and resources. \n\nJason Swencki\"s son, Kody, was diagnosed with type diabetes at six. Father and son visit the online children's forums together most evenings. \"Kody gets so excited, writing to kids from all over,\" says Swencki, one of the site's volunteers. \"They know what he's going through, so he doesn't feel alone.\" Kody is anything but alone: Diabetes is now the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, with 24 million diagnosed cases. And more people are being diagnosed at younger ages. \n\nThese days, Thomas's main focus is his charity, Fight It, which provides medicines and supplies to people--225 to date--who can't afford a diabetic's huge expenses. Fight-it.org has raised about $23,000--in products and in cash. In May, Thomas will hold the first annual Diabetic Rockstar Festival in the Caribbean. \n\nEven with a staff of 22 volunteers, Thomas often devotes up to 50 hours a week to his cause, while still doing his full-time job waiting tables. \"Of the diabetes charities out there, most are putting money into finding a cure,\" says Bentley Gubar one of Rockstar's original members. \"But Christopher is the only person I know saying people need help now.\"", "qas": [{"id": "34s9dkfk73pxndqu7y7qsuvf5vcnyf_1", "question": "What was Christopher's day job?", "answers": [{"text": "Christopher Thomas, 27, was a writer by night and a teacher by day", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Christopher Thomas, 27, was a writer by night and a teacher by day", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "teaching", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"id": "34s9dkfk73pxndqu7y7qsuvf5vcnyf_2", "question": "What disease was he diagnosed with?", "answers": [{"text": "he noticed he was always tired and was losing weight fast.

Most readers know that his real name was Samuel Longhome Clemens, but how many know where the pen name \"Mark Twain\" came from? The answer shows Clemens' colorful early life before he became a writer. \"Mark Twain\" was the cry shouted on a ship when the ship entered a part of a river that was two fathoms (6 feet) deep. \"Twain\" is an old-fashioned way of saying \"two\". Twain trained as a ship pilot on the Mississippi river for two years, a time that he wrote about in the humourousLife on the Mississippi (1883). The famous river would become an important theme in many of his works--who could forget the journey of the Huck and Jim along it in his most famous book. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884)? With little education, he had to teach himself how to write stories. Whenever possible, he would go to public libraries. There he spent much time reading and thinking, which greatly helped him with his writing. On the other hand, his life experiences gave him wonderful material to write about and attract readers. Twain wrote in a style that has been called \"local colour\" because it shows great knowledge of local people and their customs. This _ is very clear in the two books for which Twain is still celebrated today. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and its follow-up The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which many people call \"The Great American Novel\". The most amazing invention in the book is the voice of Huck himself. Huck did not enjoy schooling. It shows in the way he uses language, in a spoken style.

Guam has an area of 544 km2 (210 sq mi) and a density of 297/km\u00b2 (770/sq mi). It is the largest and southernmost of the Mariana Islands, and the largest island in Micronesia. Among its municipalities, Mongmong-Toto-Maite has the highest density at 1,425/km\u00b2 (3,691/sq mi), whereas Inarajan and Umatac have the lowest density at 47/km\u00b2 (119/sq mi). The highest point is Mount Lamlam at 406 meters (1,332 ft) above sea level. \n\nThe Chamorros, Guam's indigenous people, settled the island approximately 4,000 years ago. Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan was the first European to visit the island on March 6, 1521. Guam was colonized in 1668 with settlers, like Diego Luis de San Vitores, a Catholic missionary. Between the 1500s and the 1700s, Guam was an important stopover for the Spanish Manila Galleons. During the Spanish\u2013American War, the United States captured Guam on June 21, 1898.

Elvis and Joe have been busting bad guys and thrilling millions of readers since 1987's \"The Monkey's Raincoat.\" The books are international bestsellers, published in 42 countries, and have developed a fervent following. \n\nIn \"Taken,\" Crais's newest novel, his 15th featuring the daring duo, Elvis and Joe take on an especially bloodthirsty group of criminals called bajadores. They are bandits who prey on other bandits along the U.S.-Mexico border, dealing in drugs, murder and kidnapping. \n\n\"Taken\" is intense and fast-paced and reads like a big-budget Hollywood blockbuster. Though that's not surprising when you consider Crais began his career writing for television series like \"Hill Street Blues,\" \"Cagney & Lacey\" and \"Miami Vice.\" \n\nCNN recently spoke to the author about his new book, his loyal fans and why he's refused to bring Elvis and Joe to the big screen. The following is an edited transcript. \n\nCNN: How has writing about Elvis Cole and Joe Pike changed over the course of the series? \n\nCrais: I really strive to bring something new to each book. I don't want to write the same book over and over again. I've done Elvis books; I've done Joe books; I've done mixed books, but this time, I made a conscious decision I wanted to tell a story where I could split the book pretty much down the middle and give them 50-50 equal footing so they both have their starring roles. When I discovered this particular story, it just seemed a perfect way to do that. Part of the book, they're working together. Then there's Elvis' track through the story, and there's Joe track, where he's trying to find Elvis and save him. So it just seemed like an ideal way to let these guys share the stage.

Under a microscope, tau appears as brown tangles that look similar to dementia. Except the cases of CTE have shown this progressive, dementia-like array in players well in advance of a typical dementia diagnosis, which typically occurs in the 70s or 80s. \n\nMike Webster, an offensive lineman with the Pittsburgh Steelers whose CTE was also diagnosed posthumously, was 50 when he died.

The province is named after its largest city and regional capital, Lublin, and its territory is made of four historical lands: the western part of the voivodeship, with Lublin itself, belongs to Lesser Poland, the eastern part of Lublin Area belongs to Red Ruthenia, and the northeast belongs to Polesie and Podlasie. \n\nLublin Voivodeship is bordered by Subcarpathian Voivodeship to the south, \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Voivodeship to the south-west, Masovian Voivodeship to the west and north, Podlaskie Voivodeship along a short boundary to the north, and Belarus and Ukraine to the east.

Before the middle of the 16th century, there were few Jews in the area, concentrated in Lublin, Kazimierz Dolny, and perhaps Che\u0142m; but the founding of new private towns led to a large movement of Jews into the region to develop trade and services. Since these new towns competed with the existing towns for business, there followed a low-intensity, long-lasting feeling of resentment, with failed attempts to limit the Jewish immigration. The Jews tended to settle mostly in the cities and towns, with only individual families setting up businesses in the rural regions; this urban/rural division became another factor feeding resentment of the newly arrived economic competitors. By the middle of the 18th century, Jews were a significant part of the population in Kra\u015bnik, Lubart\u00f3w and \u0141\u0119czna.", "qas": [{"id": "3q5zz9zevofeiit6qudaz07rl34584_1", "question":

drug conspiracy charges in a federal court in Brownsville, Texas, on Monday. \n\nRafael Cardenas Vela, 38, admitted to being a \"plaza boss\" in the Gulf Cartel, which prosecutors said was responsible for smuggling thousands of kilograms of cocaine and marijuana into the United States from Mexico. \n\nCardenas Vela was arrested by federal agents during a traffic stop in southern Texas in October. \n\nHis uncle, Osiel Cardenas Guillen, led the Matamoros-based Gulf Cartel before he was convicted in 2010 on drug trafficking charges and sentenced to serve 25 years at the supermax prison in Fremont County, Colorado. \n\nCardenas Vela fled to the United States in May 2011 to escape an internal power struggle in the cartel after the November 2010 death of another uncle, Ezequiel Cardenas Guillen, according to the U.S. Attorney's office. \n\nHe was still able to control his drug territory through the use of e-mails to key leadership within the cartel, the prosecutors said. \n\nHis operation purchased 70 to 80 kilograms of cocaine each month in southern Mexico, which was then smuggled across the U.S. border in small vehicles about 16 to 20 kilograms at a time, prosecutors said. \n\n\"At the time of Cardenas' arrest, it was discovered he had approximately 500 men equipped and ready to respond to his call,\" prosecutors said in a news release. \n\nCardenas Vela, who is scheduled to be

In an exclusive interview with CNN, three-time Formula One world champion, Jackie Stewart had no hesitation in naming his choice for the greatest driver of all-time. \n\nThree-time F1 champion, Jackie Stewart back in his heyday. \n\n\"My hero, and the man I most respected and probably still do is Juan Manuel Fangio.\" Stewart told CNN. \n\nIt's not misty-eyed nostalgia for a bygone era that persuades \"The Flying Scot,\" as Stewart became known. And it wasn't just Fangio's tally of world titles that convinced Stewart; it is the manner in which the Argentine legend saw off his rivals. Who do you think is the greatest? \n\n\"Fangio won five world championships almost in a different car every year. He had the dignity, the style and the ability,\" Stewart explained. \n\nWhat's more, as Stewart points out, Fangio didn't start racing in Formula One until he was 39-years-old, and whether driving a Ferrari, Lancia, Maserati or Mercedes, he kept on winning races. \n\nThough Fangio was the greatest, Stewart rated fellow countryman Jim Clark as the best driver he raced against. \n\n\"His batting average was very good and he didn't race in too many grands prix.\" Clark -- who was tragically killed racing at Hockenheim in 1968 -- won 25 of his 73 Formula One races. Stewart's record is comparable, winning 27 from 100 starts. \n\nIt's this win to race ratio that really separates the good from the great Stewart believes.

To his surprise, Miriam strenuously opposed his going to the Bannister house on any pretence until Mr. Bannister had called upon him, and showed so much earnest feeling on the subject that he relinquished his intention.

Consequently, Weinreich gives the definition \"A person's identity is defined as the totality of one's self-construal, in which how one construes oneself in the present expresses the continuity between how one construes oneself as one was in the past and how one construes oneself as one aspires to be in the future\"; this allows for definitions of aspects of identity, such as: \"One's ethnic identity is defined as that part of the totality of one's self-construal made up of those dimensions that express the continuity between one's construal of past ancestry and one's future aspirations in relation to ethnicity\" (Weinreich, 1986a). \n\nThe description or representation of individual and group identity is a central task for psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists and those of other disciplines where \"identity\" needs to be mapped and defined.

Following on from the work of Kelly, Erikson, Tajfel and others Weinreich's Identity Structure Analysis (ISA), is \"a structural representation of the individual's existential experience, in which the relationships between self and other agents are organised in relatively stable structures over time \u2026 with the emphasis on the socio-cultural milieu in which self relates to other agents and institutions\" (Weinreich and Saunderson, (eds) 2003, p1). Using constructs drawn from the salient discourses of the individual, the group and cultural norms, the practical operationalisation of ISA provides a methodology that maps how these are used by the
